## Introduction {#intro}

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal
Art," is meant to express a worry I have about the future of
liberal education. This puts me in a sizable club. To have
worries at all has become reflexive among those
of us in any way devoted to this education. And there is no
end these days, it seems, to prophecies, even
pronouncements, of death. Type the words "death of liberal
education" into Google, and you get back such headlines as

> [Why Liberal Arts Education is Dying (or Already Dead)](http://www.aleteia.org/en/education/documents/why-liberal-arts-education-is-dying-or-already-dead-228015)

All these headlines, I think, have one thing in common.
While they may disagree about the threat to liberal
education, they agree in distinguishing liberal education
from the threat, as if the threat were external. The
headlines make you think something *else* is killing liberal
education, whether it be liberals or conservatives or
technology or the economy. And it is hard to envision
a defense of liberal education without such a distinction,
even if headlines draw it simplistically, or even
inaccurately. For if liberal education itself were somehow
the threat, then death might well be liberal education's
best defense, but in defeat. No surprise, then, that those
of us devoted to liberal education are wont to conceive its
threats as if they came from outside it. For this justifies
a defense that succeeds only if liberal education survives.

And there is no shortage of such defenses. Type the words
"defense of liberal education" into Google, and you will
find one, it seems, for every headline predicting the death
of liberal education. And not just in articles. There are
books to defend liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There are blogs to defend liberal education, including [one
at St. John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/)
featuring regular posts by Christopher Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] <!--Perhaps mention that you'll be quoting from
this in what follows.--> There are campaigns to defend liberal
education, with slogans like *Securing America's Future: The
Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention just [one
initiative](http://www.cic.edu/Research-and-Data/Liberal-Arts/Campaign/Pages/default.aspx),
launched in 2012 by the Council of Independent
Colleges.[^campaigns] And behind these campaigns are
associations to defend liberal education, like the
just-mentioned [Council of Independent
Colleges](http://www.cic.edu/About-CIC/Pages/default.aspx),
or the [Association of American Colleges and
Universities](https://www.aacu.org/about), or the
[Association for General and Liberal
Studies](http://www.agls.org/AboutUs.htm), or the
[Association for Core Texts and
Courses](http://www.coretexts.org/), or the [American
Academy for Liberal
Education](http://www.aale.org/index.php/about-aale/mission).
There are so many defenders of liberal education, in fact,
that you can even find
[think-pieces](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/19/liberal-arts-colleges-rethink-their-messaging-face-criticism)
pondering why they seem to have failed, since liberal
education remains in peril.

But what if the defenders have succeeded---by putting
liberal education in peril? What if the threat to liberal
education comes from within? This is my worry. Let the idea
of a liberal art, for the moment, simply mean whatever it is
that distinguishes a liberal education from any other form
of education---a technical education, say. What if our many
defenses of liberal education have made us forget this idea?
What if the idea of a liberal art is lost?

## Part One {#one}

Now in one sense, I think, the threat to liberal education
must always come from within. The fate of liberal education,
after all, will not be decided in headlines, but in
choices made by each of us about the best education, once
education matters. Not the best education, then, in general,
as such, *per se*; but the best education for my daughter,
or my son, or me. In having to make such choices, those
devoted to liberal education are no different from those
dismissive of it.  And in this respect, the threat to
liberal education can never lie outside it. To pursue an
education at all, liberal or no, is to have answered
a question that a liberal education obliges each of us to
ask, and ask on our own behalf: What does it mean to be
educated? And we might well answer this question in a choice
*against* liberal education, even at the risk of its
extinction, if the same choice is made repeatedly. But this
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the question is
real, and the threat to liberal education therefore
intrinsic to it. The death of liberal education, so
understood, would similarly come from within, in a proof of
its life, and perhaps the only proof of life.

But again, those of us devoted to liberal education are
unlikely to want this death, especially just to show we were
devoted to something rather than nothing. And while the
threat may be internal in this general sense, it is still
external, I think, in a specific sense.
For if the threat to liberal education does come from
within, in a question it would have us ask for ourselves
about what it means to be educated, then while we may well
answer this question in a choice against liberal education,
we may also answer the question otherwise, by choosing
liberal education. Liberal education would then be a second
answer to the question, opposed to the first. And insofar as
one answer opposes the other, the threat to liberal
education would be external. 

But if the threat *is* external, as one answer opposed to
another, then we can infer at least one thing, I think, about any
defense of liberal education against this threat. It will
have to convince us that liberal education *does* provide an
answer, even for those who give a different answer. It will
have to show us that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, whatever might be gained; and that the
answer we give in such a choice, even if it turns out right,
risks being wrong. And showing this much, it seems, means
showing there is something learned in liberal education,
that would otherwise go unlearned. To show, in short, that
liberal education has a subject-matter. Or, in a word:
content. <!--Later, give more simple description of problem:
that not having content means not being an answer to the
question.-->

But what, then, *is* this content? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone? Traditionally, the
content of a liberal education was identified with
a curriculum of seven liberal arts, a so-called *trivium* of
grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and a *quadrivium* of
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Each of these
arts was thought to wed a skill to a subject. And
together, these arts were thought to form a whole. This is
why one could say there was *something* to learn in
a liberal education, rather than many things, or anything,
or nothing. This is also what I want to say is contained in
the idea of a liberal art: a skill wedded to a subject, in
a whole of such skills and subjects, that gives a liberal
education its content. 

But one might also suspect that a liberal education has no
content in this sense, and that the liberal arts as
traditionally conceived show us why. They were learned,
after all, by the few rather than the many---the leisured
few, in that sense already free from servitude. Perhaps the
education they received was 'liberal,' then, not in
liberating them, but in shaping them, stamping them, and
perpetuating them. And the same might be suspected of any
content. For in what sense could we be freed by it, rather
than bound to it? What distinguishes content, so-called,
from dogma, or doctrine? What keeps it from closing the mind
that a truly liberal education is meant to open? 

This suspicion of content can also come from the opposite
direction, so to speak: by what we take to threaten liberal
education, or indeed any form of education. For leaving
headlines aside, this threat can seem to reflect a kind of
triumph of content over context, from college rankings and
scorecards at the start, to tests and grades at the end,
making the very meaning of education a matter of data-driven
results; and a choice against liberal education the answer
to a question never asked. Or we might conceive this threat
in economic terms, reducing education to just another
a product with a price in the global marketplace. Against
all this, the first thing we might think to say in defense
of education is that products are not enough, results are
not enough, answers are not enough, content is not enough. 

Defenses of liberal education, accordingly, have generally
made education a matter of context rather than content. And
the most common way of doing this is to locate learning not
in a set of subjects, but instead in the self. Thus [it is
said that](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/12/11/looking-value-college-wrong/) "the maturation of the student---not information
transfer---is the real purpose of colleges and
universities." [Or that](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/joannecreighton/article_liberal99) "if we are to
navigate skillfully the turbulent changes of the
twenty-first century, we must educate students not only to
process information effectively, but to think wisely and
well."

And talk of turbulent changes points to another way that
defenses of liberal education have made it a matter of
context: by locating the self in an ever-changing world.
[A good 
example](http://www.sjc.edu/files/8013/9593/4530/league-of-women-voters-2011.pdf)
comes from an address by President Nelson: 

> With boundaries among the disciplines vanishing, with job
requirements and needs changing rapidly, we need citizens
prepared for change, prepared to adapt to jobs that do not
yet exist, prepared to enter an unknown world with a kind of
fearless determination to undertake whatever is required to
succeed. We will need skills of inquiry to enter a world we
cannot yet even envision.

We can begin to see from this quote why making liberal
education a matter of context rather than content, means
forgetting, more or less deliberately,  the idea of
a liberal art. For suppose we did live in a world that
changes more than it abides, where our freedom, to the
extent this depended on skill, were a matter of adaptation
more than application. <!--Later correct this as a world
that doesn't change, because the truth doesn't change.-->
Any art that deserved the name 'liberal', in that case,
would involve a skill more likely divorced from any subject
than wedded to one; which is to say, a skill that can be
applied to many subjects, even to every subject. And suppose
the number of such subjects to have multiplied past
counting, in one way the world indeed seems to have changed,
since the advent of modern science. <!--Perhaps allude to
this later. Modern science produces diversity; ancient
science a totality.--> If the liberal arts could still be
said to encompass a set of subjects, then it would seem
better understood as a diversity than as a totality.   

So once defenses of liberal education make it a matter of
context, it is unsurprising that they separate its skills
from its subjects.  The subjects, if they are specified at
all, are specified to give an impression of breadth, as if
there were many things one might learn in a liberal
education rather than just one. The current St. John's
website, for example,
[speaks](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts)
of the college's "wide-ranging, interdisciplinary
curriculum," where "areas of study include philosophy,
literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and
languages." Other lists of subjects are even more expansive.
One from the earlier-mentioned *Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign [makes it
sound](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
as if you might study anything:  

> You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors
that are included in the liberal arts. They include much
more than studio art and English classes (though those are
great!)---they range from mathematics to Mandarin, from
statistics to sociology. At liberal arts colleges and
universities students can study the sciences---such as
biology, chemistry, and physics---and social
sciences---including economics, political science, and
psychology. Students can study newer subjects, such as
environmental science and neuroscience, and traditional
ones, too.

This same impression of breadth is given in the way defenses
of liberal education present its skills apart from subjects.
You can indeed learn anything, then, in learning *how* to
learn. And this encompasses a range of skills similarly
presented apart from subjects: how to read, how to write,
how to speak, even how to think.[^ZakariaEarthly] St. John's
current way of putting this is [to
claim](<http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/>) that its
students "learn to speak articulately, read attentively,
reason effectively, and think creatively."

[^ZakariaEarthly]: A good example of this is found in Fareed Zakaria, ["What is
the Earthly Use of Liberal
Education."](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fareed-zakaria/fareed-zakaria-liberal-arts-education_b_5380896.html)

In a similar vein, defenses of liberal education will call
the liberal arts "transferable skills," [^transferable],
again against the backdrop of an ever-changing job market.
And "usefulness" has become a ubiquitous word to counter
the opinion, and the traditional conviction, that the
liberal arts are useless. <!--Bring "useless" back up
later, and give a defense of it--> It is more generally the
habit in defenses of liberal education to talk of the
liberal arts as if they empowered us rather than enlightened
us---the aforementioned [*Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign](http://www.liberalartspower.org/Pages/default.aspx)
being the most explicit example.

[^Linker]: "How can liberal education be saved? By becoming truly, enduringly
useful." <>

[^transferable]: "Although modern liberal arts curriculums have an updated
choice of a larger range of subjects, it still retains the
core aims of the liberal arts curricula maintained by the
medieval universities: to develop well-rounded individuals
with general knowledge of a wide range of subjects and with
mastery of a range of transferable skills. They will become
‘global citizens’, with the capacity to pursue lifelong
learning and become valuable members of their communities."
<http://www.topuniversities.com/blog/what-liberal-arts-education>

There are deeper strains in this line of defense, that
try to reach beyond a liberal education's usefulness for any
career, to the way it might be useful for life, making the
self, in sense, the subject of its skills. A liberal arts
education can be "truly, enduringly useful," so [one
recent 
defense puts
it](http://theweek.com/articles/559681/how-save-liberal-arts-education),
once it is "oriented
towards the question of how to live." Or as President Nelson [has
written](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2015/02/26/hiring-grads-whats-going-part-iv/): 

> The primary purpose of college---contrary to the opinion of
> hiring managers---is not to provide trained-up workers for
> business, nor even to provide young people with the skills
> needed to make a living. The primary purpose is to help
> young people develop the character and the judgment to
> shape a life worth living.

In these appeals to the way a life might be shaped, defenses
of liberal education might be said to deepen the sense in
which liberal education is a matter of context, not content,
by locating what is learned in a cultivated readiness for
the world, whatever the world may hold. Here is how a recent
St. John's graduate puts it: 

> After my two-year commitment with Teach For America,
I hope to continue my work in the field of education. But
really, I can do anything. St. John’s has given me the
tools: the ability to listen, to think, to speak, to write,
and ultimately, to act. I need only to decide where to
direct my passion, and the world is mine, thanks to the
incredible education I have had the blessing to receive
here. [^Tyson]

[^Tyson]: This comes from Grace Tyson, ["'When You Know Better, You Do Better': A Senior's Reflections on St. John's](http://www.thejohnniechair.com/when-you-know-better-you-do-better-a-seniors-reflections-on-st-johns/). Parts of this address are also quoted in Christopher Nelson, [Is It Worth It?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-nelson/is-it-worth-it_1_b_3321206.html).

And there are ways to deepen this context still further; the
most common being to take this readiness for the world as an
openness to the world, whether the self so opened is
described as curious, inquisitive, imaginative,
self-critical, or sympathetic. Thus we find Martha Nussbaum,
to pick on a famous example, [defending liberal
education](http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0709s.pdf)
insofar as it develops

1. The capacity for Socratic
self-criticism and critical thought about one's own traditions.
2. The ability to see oneself as a member of a heterogeneous nation
and world.
3. The ability to sympathetically imagine the lives of people different
from oneself.

And as suggested by Nussbaum's reference to Socrates, the
sense in which a truly liberal education opens minds rather
than closes them has particular appeal at St. John's, where
it would now sound antiquated to claim, as Scott Buchanan
did in the first catalog of the New Program, that the
liberal arts put us in possession of the truth.[^Buchanan]
What we say instead is self-consciously Socratic. Thus President 
Nelson [will say that](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/10/20/knowing-learn/) "liberal education is the best and
quickest way to become comfortable not
knowing." [Or that](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/11/10/accountability-commodifying-examined-life/) "learning is grounded in recognition and
acceptance of one’s own ignorance."
Or as the same St. John's
graduate I quoted earlier puts it: 

> I have learned that great questions lead to more and more
questions, not necessarily to answers, and I have learned
that the greatness of the human spirit shows itself in just
this realization. As Socrates says in Plato’s *Meno*: “We
shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think
that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we
indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no
use in seeking to know what we do not know.” We must have
intellectual bravery, that is, the courage to push forward,
to continue seeking truth even in the face of doubts about
its very existence.

[^Buchanan]: "The arts of apprehending, understanding, and knowing the
truth are the liberal arts, and they set their own ends."
(*Bulletin of St. John's College in Annapolis, 1937--38*).

It is this same Socratic self-consciousness that explains
how St. John's can make even an all-required program of
books, which might thought inescapably full of content, into
a matter of context. For anything written down, we might
claim, is simply doctrine, until a reader puts it into
dialogue by questioning it rather than assimilating it. And
underlying this shift from doctrine to dialogue is perhaps
the deepest belief one can have about a truly liberal
education: that we are only able to learn, truly learn,
insofar as we do this for ourselves. It would seem to follow
directly from this that *what* we learn is found indeed in
the self, or even the soul, rather than in a set of
subjects. And the more liberal an education becomes, so we
could say, the more that *what* we learn is a matter of
*how* we learn, and *who* we become in learning it. Which at
this college, at least, means the more that any so-called
subject is found in a book, which is found in a reader of
that book, who is found in a conversation about that book,
which brings the book to life, with all it may contain. And
this conversation, both with others and with oneself, might
then be said to exemplify the sense in which a liberal
education is ultimately a matter of context rather than
content. For this is an education in selfhood rather than
subjects, where the something we finally learn is what it
means to learn, and even what it means to love it.   

The suspicion that a truly liberal education has no content,
then, can be cast in terms that encompass what many of us,
I think, might say a liberal education finally is, and where
any appeal to a number of liberal arts seems beside the
point. St. John's even tried dropping any reference to the
liberal arts, along with any mention of liberal education,
when it first launched its new website, as if indeed to
forget the whole idea. But it did this, I think, to locate
the place of a liberal education in the present rather than
the past. It was only a matter of months before the college
restored these references to its website, since there were
prospective students still using such terms to find such
things. But St. John's has otherwise remained embarked, like
nearly every other liberal arts college in the country,
on a communications project carried out in images rather
than text, in the attempt not simply to say what a liberal
education is, but to show it, and capture something about
the *experience* of a liberal education when mere
explanations are thought no longer enough. Gone are the days
when the college could package its education, as it were, in
a brown paper wrapper, as if the education were not only
a matter of content, but the kind of content that couldn't
be seen from outside. Even the first video St. John's made
of itself, back in 1954, was mostly staged and performed
in vignettes, retaining at least that much separation from
the ongoing world. But it is just this separation that is
now deemed better erased than preserved, leading to efforts
that range from the Summer Academy to the college's
Instagram feed, as if to give the impression that what
separates the college from the outside world is only
a window, and a window more often open than shut. At its
worst, this project might be said to pander or flatter
rather than inform or educate; but at its best, it might be
said to make St. John's finally look like a college rather
than a cult. Or to put the sense of this strategy more
generally: it tries to defend liberal education by locating the place
of liberal education *within* the world rather than apart from
it. ---And this is perhaps the most visible way that a liberal
education is now being made a matter of context rather than
content. 

[Back to top](#top)

## Part Two {#two}

By this point in my lecture, however, I think one could make
an objection. For I haven't yet given any grounds for
*worrying* about any of this. If we *have* lost the idea of
a liberal art, by making liberal education a matter of
context rather than content, then at most all I have shown
so far is that we have lost this idea deliberately, in what
might be called *an act* of forgetting. So let me now
explain my worry, which the rest of the lecture will try to
justify. My worry is that in losing this idea, more or less
deliberately, we risk another loss beyond our control: which
is to lose any way of giving a clear and compelling answer
to the question of what it means to be educated. ---Which is
to say, an answer that distinguishes liberal education from
any other form of education; and that sheds any light, in
turn, on what is lost in a choice against liberal education,
whatever might be gained. I worry, then, that once the idea
of a liberal art is lost in defense of liberal education,
the defense is lost. And once the defense is lost, liberal
education is lost.  

To begin to see all this, I want now to revisit the various
ways that defenses of liberal education have made it a matter
of context. For example: the basic set
of skills, again separated from subjects, that defenses of
liberal education claim are imparted by it. There is no doubt
that learning how to learn, along with how to read, write,
speak, and think, are useful skills; and one might even
grant their necessity for a life lived in freedom. But it is
hard to see how these skills belong to a liberal education
rather than to any education. And the more indispensable
these skills sound, the harder it is to conceive them as
liberal rather than remedial. Shouldn't we already know how
to learn, and read, write, speak, and think, before we go to
college?

There are, of course, ways to specify such skills, but they
reflect another aspect of the problem. To recall St. John's
way of doing this, in a liberal education you learn how to
speak articulately, read attentively, reason effectively,
think creatively. But are we we then to believe that you'll
be left speaking inarticulately, reading inattentively,
reasoning ineffectively, or thinking uncreatively, if you
choose another kind of education---say, to pursue a degree
in computer programming? This is doubtful. But if so, then
what again distinguishes a liberal education from any
education? 

The same problem emerges from the attempt to distinguish
a liberal education on higher-sounding grounds. In [one of
his
blogposts](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/03/11/five-reasons-to-attend-st-johns-college/?_ga=1.184745897.1475954775.1399757768),
for example, President Nelson writes: "St. John’s College is
the right fit for someone who is seeking a special sort of
education---an education in the arts of freedom, an
education in how to make learning and life their own." But
one could ask how such encompassing terms could distinguish
a St. John's education from any education, or even from
human experience as such. For isn't the distinction between
experience and innocence, or experience and endurance, found
in just the kind of learning, and living, that is
necessarily one's own? Or suppose we take our bearings from
Socrates, and claim that St. John's will teach you
intellectual courage: how to persevere in the pursuit of
knowledge rather than yield in the face of ignorance.
Perhaps St. John's will, but so then will any field of
research one might pursue, it could be argued, that relies
on science to reach its results rather than superstition.
And direct appeals to Socrates, as if the Enlightenment never
happened, won't be enough to distinguish St. John's in
particular, or liberal education more generally, on the
matter of intellectual courage. 

But there is a whole other side to this problem. Insofar as
it becomes hard to distinguish a liberal education from any
education when it is made a matter of context, it becomes
easy to make a choice against liberal education merely by
wanting an education with content. To consider this problem
from one angle, take the penchant in education nowadays for
testing and ranking and training and specializing. It may be
good and even necessary to speak against all this in defense
of liberal education. But this risks the impression that
a liberal education is an education for dilettantes,
providing an escape from being challenged or judged or
driven or dedicated. And what can be said to correct this
impression, if in a liberal education, these virtues are
matters of context rather than content? Matters, that is,
about which nothing more, really, can be said, but only
shown---where you see such students for yourself? Or even be
such a student yourself? For as one noted defender of
liberal education, Andrew Delbanco, [has put
it](http://chronicle.com/article/College-at-Risk/130893/):

> One of the difficulties in making the case
for liberal education against the rising tide of skepticism
is that it is almost impossible to persuade doubters who
have not experienced it for themselves. The Puritan founders
of our oldest colleges would have called it "such a mystery
as none can read but they that know it."

This way of putting the problem captures what is potentially
self-defeating in defenses of liberal education that make it
a matter of context. For if the point of any defense is *to
persuade* people to experience liberal education for
themselves, then how can there be a defense that depends on
such an experience to be persuasive?   

There are, of course, ways of trying to capture this
experience in images, as I earlier discussed in the case of
St. John's. But this same case reflects the problem. If we
make its education a matter of context, by showing a student
playing croquet, or reading a book on a bench near a tree,
or even speaking with passion and eloquence about how much
her education means, we haven't yet distinguished St.
John's from any other college where such things might be
said or done---even though St. John's is unique, in having
renounced the elective system and established an
all-required curriculum. But St. John's is unique, then, as
a matter of content, not context. And something similar by
way of distinction-erasing might be said of the defenses
of liberal education more generally. For if these defenses 
were products of a liberal education, one might have
expected them to reflect a diversity of views, or an
originality of thought. But so far as these defenses make
liberal education a matter of context, and speak of the kind
of skills one needs to flourish in life, it becomes hard not
to speak in platitudes or commonplaces. And indeed these
defenses more or less follow a script: In an ever-changing
world, now more than ever, we need the truly useful arts of
a liberal education. Even President Nelson hasn't quite
managed to liberate himself from this script, even though
I regard him as a gifted writer, who is making the most
of the script.   

Still, I suspect that those of us devoted to liberal
education will need more than a script to survive. And if my
lecture so far is right, this means finding what we have
lost, or recollecting what we have forgotten. So in the time
I have left, I want to sketch one way back
to the idea of a liberal art.

## Part Three {#three}

To take the first step back, I want you to imagine that we
have shut every window at St. John's College, and drawn
every curtain, as if St. John's were indeed a cult. Or to
put this more generously: as if the place of liberal
education were not within the world but apart from it. But
why would we believe this? We would believe it, I think,
because of something we believed about the freedom promised
by a liberal education. We would take this freedom to be
important enough, yet fragile enough, to protect its
pursuit.  We would regard this freedom as invaluable, then,
but not indispensable. A life could be lived, and even lived
well, without it. And this would be why its pursuit would
need protection from the outside world. For it would be
a freedom that might well be forgotten in the living of
life; or even dismissed, or denied---for example, in the
choice of another form of education. Or in the quest for
power, or the pursuit of success. The kind of freedom that
someone like Meno might not want, but that his slave-boy
might need, to be free at all. The kind of freedom, then,
that might be possessed even by those in chains, or in
prison, or in poverty. The kind of freedom we can still
possess at the moment of death, when there is no life left
to live. The kind of freedom you can count on, then, not
when you might do anything, but when you can do nothing. At
moments of life when you might be said to need a useless
skill, not a useful one.

But what kind of freedom could this be? The answer, I think,
takes us a second step back. For this would be a freedom,
I think, that transcends the horizons of life, and indeed be
the freedom it is---perhaps the highest kind there is---in
having no horizons. But what does having no horizons mean?
Here is one answer, and to my mind the best answer: having
no horizons means having the truth. And a liberal education,
then, would promise you the truth. 

If this promise sounds ridiculous, then good. For if what
I have so far argued is right, then we are better off saying
ridiculous things than obvious things in defense of liberal
education. But this promise, you'll also have to admit, is
one way, and perhaps the simplest way, to claim that
a liberal education has content. And truth might be the only
way to understand a content that frees us rather than binds
us. The promise of truth should also sound attractive, at
least if there is any chance to keep the promise. But
perhaps you think no liberal arts college these days would
dare to make the promise. Well, you would be wrong. At the
time I write this sentence (which was yesterday), the
college whose curriculum most resembles St. John's had the
slogan "Truth Matters" emblazoned across [its home
page](http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/). And this same college
began [its own
defense](http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/a-liberating-education)
of liberal education by claiming that "to learn is to
discover and grow in the truth about reality. It is the
truth, and nothing less, that sets men free." 

Now, I have to admit
that the college in question is Thomas Aquinas. And perhaps
you would tell me their belief in truth is based on their
belief in Christ. I would agree, but hasten to add that St.
John's has a source of its own for a belief in truth. Which
takes us a third step back. For though 
we may not have to believe in Christ, to believe in truth, perhaps we do
have to believe in Ptolemy.

But what do I mean by a belief in Ptolemy? To explain what
I mean, and to take yet another step back to the idea of
a liberal art, I'm going to turn now *not* to Ptolemy, but
instead to Socrates, and indeed, a Socrates we are all
familiar with, from Plato's *Meno*. I do this because if St.
John's can already be said to believe in anything, it
believes in this: you can only learn, truly learn, insofar
as you do this for yourself. But if Socrates's myth of
recollection to Meno can be believed, then learning for
yourself would be impossible, unless you somehow already
possessed whatever you might learn. Which is all but to say:
unless you somehow already had the truth. Of course, we
might take this myth to be merely myth; and one sign of its
doubtfulness even at St. John's can be glimpsed in what
I earlier quoted from a St. John's graduate, when she
claimed that "We must have intellectual bravery, that is,
the courage to push forward, to continue seeking truth even
in the face of doubts about its very existence."
I think Socrates's myth is meant to suggest, to the
contrary, that all doubts about truth's existence are put to
rest, as soon as we start to learn. 

But I call this a suggestion, because the proof, I suspect,
actually lies in Socrates's dramatic turn to the slave-boy,
and a shift from myth to mathematics. Which brings me to my
final step back. For it is in Socrates's encounter with the
slave-boy, I think, that we can find the lost idea of
a liberal art. And to recover it, I now offer what I call
a loose reading of this
encounter. 

The central question of this episode is: how long,
exactly, is the side of an eight-foot
square? (*Meno* 82e) Now, as you no doubt know, because the line
in question is irrational, there is no answer to the
question in terms of feet. But I prefer to put this
a different way. There *is* an answer, but only insofar as
the answer is made into a matter of research, with
a divide-and-conquer approach. And this is one way to
describe the slave-boy's initial stab at the question, when
he finds that the line in question is between 2 feet and
3 feet in length, before giving up. (84a) But under one idea of
intellectual courage, we could say, we should not give up.
And we could forge ahead, on the slave-boy's behalf, in
further research, by dividing the 3 foot line even more. And
putting the results in suitably modern terms, we learn that
the line in question is between 2.8 and 2.9 feet; then we
learn it is between 2.82 and 2.83 feet; then we learn it is
between 2.828 and 2.829 feet. Or to put what we learn still
more exactly: the first number in the length of the line is
2; and the next is 8; and the next is 2; then 8; then 4;
then 2; then 7; and so on. There would be no pattern in the
numbers thereby found, but this is what would make every
number found a genuine discovery, which carried us ever
farther in truth, leading us from one learned thing to the
next. We could even say we were learning for ourselves, and
persevering in the pursuit of knowledge rather than yielding
in the face of ignorance. And I think this more or less
captures the meaning of learning in what I will call the
*idea* of a field of research, which we have inherited from
modern science.  

But again, the slave-boy gives up on this approach at the
very first number 2. And Socrates doesn't exhort him to keep
at it, or show him how to divide the 3 foot line any
further. Instead, Socrates says to the slave-boy:  if you
don't want to count the line out, then just show it to me. (84a)
---It's as if Socrates had a different idea of intellectual
courage, a different idea of learning, and a different idea
of how the question should be approached, forming a different
discipline from a field of research. And I think we can
already say why. For while you can certainly make the line
in question a matter of research, you thereby put it out of
reach---as a matter of recognition. For there is no end to the
numbers you will find in the divide-and-conquer approach to
the line in question. So you are learning more and more
about an object that you will never get to see, and in that
sense, never get to know. We will always be left, as it were,
at the first number we find, with an ever-expanding but
never-vanishing horizon at the latest number we find. Or
more simply put, we will be seeking the truth, and even advancing
the truth, but never possessing the truth.

So what idea of approach does Socrates have in mind instead?
We can see it coming-to-be in the very next thing he does
with the slave-boy. For the slave-boy is truly stumped, and
can't even show the line in question. For of course it is not
in front of the slave-boy yet; and in his mind, we might
say, it is not yet a matter of recognition, but still
a matter of research, even though he's given the project up.
So in perhaps his one outright act of teaching, giving
birth, we might say, to the very idea of a liberal art,
Socrates simply draws the line in question---erasing at once
any remaining horizon of discovery, and showing we are
already in possession of the truth. (85a) And what he does in
drawing this line radically changes what it means for the
slave-boy to learn. For this is no longer to discover any
more about the line in question, but instead to recognize
the line in question. Or perhaps I should say recollect the
line in question. But in either formulation, this means
seeing that the line Socrates has drawn is indeed the line
in question. And the slave boy does this in yet another act
of recognition, when he sees that the figure Socrates draws,
upon the line that he draws, is indeed the eight-foot square
in question. 

But let me try to clarify this by generalizing it. Let us
suppose that Socrates has asked the slave-boy a more
encompassing question. Such as: "Why do the heavens move as
they do?" One way to answer this question is again to make
it a matter of research, producing fields and even
sub-fields of research, in a divide-and-conquer approach to
the question. But this risks putting the matter beyond the
reach of recognition. True, we will learn more and more
about heavenly motions in this approach; but there is no
promise that we will ever learn enough to finally answer the
question. And this reflects one way to understand learning,
leading to one interpretation of "astronomy", that we have
inherited from modern science. But there is still another
way to understand learning, leading to another
interpretation of "astronomy," that we have inherited from
ancient science, and that promises us an answer, in
promising us the truth. And a college like ours is committed
to it, I think, if we believe that learning is a finally
a matter of recognition. 

So another way of answering the question "Why do the heavens
move as they do?" that we can still call "astronomy",
produces a liberal art. And in this approach, strange as it
may sound, we can simply answer the question, in already
possessing the truth. We don't even have to stop at one
answer: Ptolemy, as I recall, gives us two---suggesting that
the truth is more generous than frugal. And we don't even
need any telescopes. All we have to do is draw lines just
like Socrates did, that allow us to see, or more exactly see
again, the object in question. Which in this more
encompassing case is the motion of the heavens; hence we
have to draw the lines---circles, basically---that allow us
to see again, and in that sense to recognize, the very
motions of the heavens we were asking about. And in this way
we can give a true account of these motions, since this
account allows us not simply to explain what we see, as if
to move past it, but to recognize what we see, in a recovery
of it. 

But now suppose we made the question Socrates asks the
slave-boy *all*-encompassing---something like "why is the
world the way it is." In one approach---let us call this
a technical education---we would be led into ever-more
numerous fields of research to answer the question, with no
promise that we will ever recover the world by the end, in
an act of recognition. But in another approach---let us call
this a liberal education---we would be led to seven liberal
arts to answer the question, where this recovery of the
world in an act of recognition is precisely the point. And
this is why, I think, these antique seven arts might still
be said to form a whole, that gives a truly liberal
education its content.

But let me say one final thing in this spirit of
recollection on behalf of St. John's College. Let us suppose
that the truth is very generous. So generous, that when we
ask the question "Why is the world the way it is?" there is
not just one answer, or two answers, or seven answers, but
something closer to a hundred. And let us suppose that the
lines that might be drawn to produce this hundred are drawn,
not to form squares, or circles, but letters; and that the
letters are suitably arranged in words, sentences, 
paragraphs, to compose what we might call "books." Any of
the hundred so-called books, in that case, would allow us to
recover the world in an act of recognition. And we could
recognize the world in such a book, by reading it with the
same generosity possessed by the truth. The book, in that
case, would be inescapably be full of content, in being
inescapably full of truth. These are the books I think we
read at the college, and believe in. And in being
full of truth, they give to any conversation at
the college that brings them to life, a purpose, and
a point, beyond that life, proving there is more, even to
life, than life. Truth.
