# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

## Introduction

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art," is
best introduced, perhaps, if we consider a
[recent attempt](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
to answer the question: "What Are The Liberal Arts?"  Here is how the
answer starts:

> A liberal arts education means studying broadly---taking classes in
> many different subjects---and building skills that are geared toward
> more than just one profession.  By studying the liberal arts, students
> develop strong critical thinking, problem solving, and communication
> skills.  Liberal arts students learn to approach questions flexibly
> and to think across multiple disciplines.  These are skills employers
> say they value most, even more than a specific major.  **In today’s
> labor market, career paths are changing rapidly, and graduates must
> draw from a variety of skillsets to adapt to challenges and capitalize
> on opportunities.**

Already we might notice something getting lost in this answer. 
<!--Later use "forgotten" for this--> True, it speaks at comparative
length of what can be gained by a study of liberal arts.  But it says
almost nothing about what they are.  The answer so far, it seems, is
simply "many different subjects."

But as I said, this is only the start of the answer.  The answer
continues like this:

>You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors that are
>included in the liberal arts.  They include much more than studio art
>and English classes (though those are great!)---they range from
>mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology.  At liberal arts
>colleges and universities students can study the sciences---such as
>biology, chemistry, and physics---and social sciences—including
>economics, political science, and psychology.  Students can study newer
>subjects, such as environmental science and neuroscience, and
>traditional ones, too.

The answer "many different subjects" is elaborated here.  ---But only,
it seems, by way of expansion, to encompass almost any subject you
could think of, or want to study.  We might wonder what *isn't* a
liberal art on this account.  For we have gotten no answer to the
question of what *is* one, which tells us what a liberal art finally
is, no matter how many there might be.  Or, to borrow a figure from
Plato's *Meno*, we could say we've been given a *swarm* of liberal
arts, when we might have wanted just one.  This would be the one that
makes any member of the swarm, indeed, a member.  What we would want,
in that case, might be called the *idea* of a liberal art.  And it
would be this idea, then, that has gotten lost in the answer above.  We
ask what the liberal arts are, and are given too many in reply to
know.

## Being lost on any list; one way to be lost

But how many are too many?  The list just given might seem too long,
or at least too indefinite.  But consider the most definitive list I
can think of, and the most likely one you already know of.  This is
the list we've inherited from medieval times, composed of seven
liberal arts: grammar, logic, and rhetoric; arithmetic, geometry,
music and astronomy.  No more, no fewer.  Yet what makes *these* the
liberal arts?  It would seem impossible to know, unless we have some
notion, or again *idea*, of what a liberal art is, to tell us.  And if
this idea is distinct from any example, it will not be found on any
list of examples, even if the seven on this definitive list
somehow exhaust the examples.  And not to be found is one way of being
lost.  So on this argument, the idea of a liberal art will be lost on
*any* list of them, no matter how short or definite.

## Being forgotten; another way to be lost

Still, if we were persuaded by this argument, it seems we would shy
away from lists, or at least offer something more than lists, when
trying to say what a liberal art is.  But in general, we don't.  The
list I started with, for example, is again a recent one: part of an
ongoing campaign, begun in 2012, to promote the liberal arts by The
Council of Independent Colleges.[^1] And two more lists can be found
on
[the same page](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/)
of the current St. John's website.  The first list has twelve items on
it: philosophy, literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and languages.
The second list reduces this twelve to eight: music and literature,
philosophy and theology, history and social science, mathematics and
natural science.  There is nothing that accompanies either list to
explain why *these* are the liberal arts, or to explain why one
list differs from the other, or even to explain why both
differ from the medieval list you may recall. And if you do
recall this list, you likely recall little else. Perhaps you remember
that grammer, logic, and rhetoric were grouped together in what was
called a *trivium*, and the rest in a *quadrivium*, but without any
comparably clear memory of why.   in more than
just number from the medieval list you are likely to remember.

both number and kind from the medieval one. from the medieval one But
which list is the right list? Or at least, the more definitive list?
And does either list, since it differs from the medieval one, mean
that the liberal arts have changed since medieval times? Again, it
would seem that we cannot answer such questions unless we recover, or
we might even say *recollect*, the idea of a liberal art that goes
missing, or gets lost, so soon as we draw up our lists.

Or am I missing the point?  For perhaps there is no *one* list of the
liberal arts, or even competing lists, but rather many lists, even
indefinitely many.  Perhaps nearly any field of study, that is, can be
studied as a liberal art, if only it is studied in a certain way.  But
if so, then what is that way? In this case, too, it would seem that we
need the *idea* of a liberal art to know, making any mere list of them
beside the point.  Indeed, if we press the sense in which a liberal
art is, somehow, an *art*, which is to say, a certain way of doing
something, then we might think that both lists of liberal arts on the
St. John's website miss the point.  For there we are, treating the
liberal arts as if they were subjects rather than activities.  S o we
draw up a list of such things as philosophy, or physics, or
mathematics, or languages; when we should really be speaking of such
things as conversation, demonstration, translation, experimentation.
But again, to decide whether we have thusly missed the point, it would
seem that we need some sense of what a liberal art is, which no such
list, right or wrong, can provide.

Similarly, if you have any memory of the medieval notion of a
liberal art, mention what we
remember from the medieval conception, which, if it goes beyond the
list, only extends perhaps to the trivium and quadrivium categories,
along with perhaps the sense that liberal arts are those arts, or ways
of doing something, that liberate us. But none of this with any deeply
felt connection to what we do; then bring up the fact the website had
no reference to liberal arts. Then move on to this as a different way
of being lost, forgotten, and two reasons for its importance: (1) that
the forgetfulness comes with a shift in the purpose of a liberal
education; and (2) that there is an issue of content. (spell this
out.))

to promote the liberal arts, that began
in 2012. : Why? This suggests another way, a deeper way, of being
lost.  But again, this is just one way of being lost.  It is also an
obvious way of being lost.  So why do lists of liberal arts persist.
Introduce another way of being lost.  If we at St. John's were
convinced, we might feel obliged to define what we mean by a liberal
art.  (Perhaps we could say they are arts that "free" us; but we can
hear Socrates counter: what does "free" mean?)  If we---and by "we" I
mean we at St. John's College---were convinced of such an argument,
And what to make of more recent lists of liberal arts, which are
equally definite, yet differ from the medieval one, both in kind and
in number?  There are two such lists, for example, on of the
St. John's College website.  

Or again, as I have putting it, we need the very thing that is more likely lost than found on any such list, in being a list: namely, the *idea* of a liberal art. 

that only *lost* on such lists rather than found there. Stick with the motif of "being lost" and talk of next issue as a deeper sense of being lost. Mention how St. John's website at first had nothing about the liberal arts.

[Move on to explain the deeper importance of this question: the ubiquitousness of lists indicates a certain, and potentially false, understanding of our freedom, and the relation of a liberal art to our freedom.] 

Later, use distinction between servile and liberal to indicate
importance of question, then introduce Meno as a deeper exploration of it.

> Areas of study include philosophy, literature, history, mathematics,
economics, political theory, theology, biology, physics, music,
chemistry, and languages, offering a truly comprehensive liberal arts
education as illustrated in the chart below.  Start with St. John's
List, pointing out distinction between books and divisions,
comprehensive vs book's beginning, middle, and end.]
[Move on to examples of trivium and quadrivium, then to St. John's current list]
Final sentenc should be the one below] This, then, is one way to
understand my lecture's title. For it seems to be the very idea of a
liberal art that is lost [or one might say forgotton] when we identify
the liberal arts by name.

Mention how very act of specification of liberal arts runs this risk,
because of a interest in power.

[Perhaps introduce third paragraph and power here. Start with Meno and move back to example.]
Explaining why it's easy to forget. Mention recommendation from
Siegelvision] How we struck liberal arts from website.

"Lost" meaning forgotten, later meaning abandoned.

I'll come to the idea later, but I want to start by asking, why the
forgetfulness?
