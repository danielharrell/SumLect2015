# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art," is
best introduced, perhaps, if we consider a recent attempt to answer the
question: "What Are The Liberal Arts?"  Here is how the answer starts:

> A liberal arts education means studying broadly---taking classes in
> many different subjects---and building skills that are geared toward
> more than just one profession.  By studying the liberal arts, students
> develop strong critical thinking, problem solving, and communication
> skills.  Liberal arts students learn to approach questions flexibly
> and to think across multiple disciplines.  These are skills employers
> say they value most, even more than a specific major.  **In today’s
> labor market, career paths are changing rapidly, and graduates must
> draw from a variety of skillsets to adapt to challenges and capitalize
> on opportunities.**

Already we might notice something getting lost in this answer.
<!--Later use "forgotten" for this--> True, it speaks at comparative
length of what can be gained by a study of liberal arts.  But it says
almost nothing about what they are.  The answer so far, it seems, is
simply "many different subjects."

But as I said, this is only the start of the answer.  The answer
continues like this:

>You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors that are
>included in the liberal arts.  They include much more than studio art
>and English classes (though those are great!)---they range from
>mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology.  At liberal arts
>colleges and universities students can study the sciences---such as
>biology, chemistry, and physics---and social sciences—including
>economics, political science, and psychology.  Students can study newer
>subjects, such as environmental science and neuroscience, and
>traditional ones, too.

The answer "many different subjects" is elaborated here.  But only, it
seems, by way of expansion, to encompass almost any subject you could
think of, or want to study.  We might wonder what *isn't* a liberal art
on this account.  For we have gotten no answer to the question of what
*is* one, which tells us what a liberal art finally is, no matter how
many there might be.  Or to borrow a figure from Plato's *Meno*, we
could say we've been given a *swarm* of liberal arts, when we might have
wanted just one.  This would be the one liberal art, so to speak, that
makes any member of the swarm, indeed, a member.  What we would want, in
that case, might be called the *idea* of a liberal art.  And it would be
this idea, then, that has gotten lost in the answer above. We ask what
the liberal arts are, and are given too many in reply to know.

But how many are too many?  For it can seem as if the idea of a liberal
art will be lost in any list, no matter how definite.  The most
definitive such list I can think of is the medieval one, which divides
the liberal arts into one group of three, the *trivium*, inclusive of
grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and another group of four, the
*quadrivium*, inclusive of arithmetic and geometry, music and astronomy.
Let us suppose these seven, then, are indeed the liberal arts---no more,
no fewer.  But what makes them so? It would seem impossible to know,
unless we have some notion, or again *idea*, of what a liberal art is,
to tell us. Yet if this idea is distinct from any instance, or example,
it will not be found on any list of examples, even if the seven listed
here exhaust the examples. And not to be found is a way of being lost.

And what to make of more recent lists of liberal arts, which are equally
definite, yet differ from the medieval one, both in kind and in number?
There are two such lists, for example, on
[the same page](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/)
of the St. John's College website.  The first has twelve items:
philosophy, literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and languages.
The second list, just below the first, has eight items, with six of the
eight put in pairs, like so: literature, philosophy and theology,
history and social science, mathematics and natural science,
music. Which list is the right list? Or at least, the more definitive
list? And does either list, since it differs from the medieval one, mean
that the liberal arts have changed since medieval times? Again, it would
seem that we cannot answer such questions unless we recover, or we might
even say *recollect*, the idea of a liberal art that goes missing, or
gets lost, so soon as we draw up our
lists. [Put different take on liberal arts here, in terms of activities.]

Or do my questions here suggest that I'm missing the point? For
perhaps there is no one list of the liberal arts, or even competing
lists; but rather many lists, even indefinitely many, to suggest that
nearly any field of study can be studied as a liberal art, if only it is
studied in a certain way. Well okay then---but what is that way? In this
case too, it would seem that we need the idea of a liberal art to know,
and all the more reason to find the indefintely long list of liberal
arts I began with beside the point, even if I'm missing the point. Or
perhaps the list is meant to capture a power. do my
questions suggest I've missed the point, and that there are many ways to
list the liberal arts?


Later, use distinction between servile and liberal to indicate
importance of question, then introduce Meno as a deeper exploration of it.

> Areas of study include philosophy, literature, history, mathematics,
economics, political theory, theology, biology, physics, music,
chemistry, and languages, offering a truly comprehensive liberal arts
education as illustrated in the chart below.  Start with St. John's
List, pointing out distinction between books and divisions,
comprehensive vs book's beginning, middle, and end.]
[Move on to examples of trivium and quadrivium, then to St. John's current list]
Final sentenc should be the one below] This, then, is one way to
understand my lecture's title. For it seems to be the very idea of a
liberal art that is lost [or one might say forgotton] when we identify
the liberal arts by name.

Mention how very act of specification of liberal arts runs this risk,
because of a interest in power.

[Perhaps introduce third paragraph and power here. Start with Meno and move back to example.]
Explaining why it's easy to forget. Mention recommendation from
Siegelvision] How we struck liberal arts from website.

"Lost" meaning forgotten, later meaning abandoned.

I'll come to the idea later, but I want to start by asking, why the
forgetfulness?
