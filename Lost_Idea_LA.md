# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

## Introduction

<!--Perhaps replace "defenses" with "defenders" in much of what
follows-->

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal
Art," is meant to express a worry I have about the future of
liberal education. This puts me in a sizable club. To have
worries at all has become reflexive among those
of us in any way devoted to this education. And there is no
end these days, it seems, to prophecies, even
pronouncements, of death. Type the words "death of liberal
education" into Google, and you get back such headlines as

All these headlines, I think, have one thing in common.
While they may disagree about the threat to liberal
education, they agree in distinguishing liberal education
from the threat, as if the threat were external. The
headlines make you think something *else* is killing liberal
education, whether it be liberals or conservatives or
technology or the economy. And it is hard to envision
a defense of liberal education without such a distinction,
even if headlines draw it simplistically, or even
inaccurately. For if liberal education itself were somehow
the threat, then death might well be liberal education's
best defense, but in defeat. No surprise, then, that those
of us devoted to liberal education are wont to conceive its
threats as if they came from outside it. For this justifies
a defense that succeeds only if liberal education survives.

And there is no shortage of such defenses. Type the words
"defense of liberal education" into Google, and you will
find one, it seems, for every headline predicting the death
of liberal education. And not just in articles. There are
books to defend liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There are blogs to defend liberal education, including [one
at St. John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/)
featuring regular posts by Christopher Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] <!--Perhaps mention that you'll be quoting from
this in what follows.--> There are campaigns to defend liberal
education, with slogans like *Securing America's Future: The
Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention just [one
initiative](http://www.cic.edu/Research-and-Data/Liberal-Arts/Campaign/Pages/default.aspx),
launched in 2012 by the Council of Independent
Colleges.[^campaigns] And behind these campaigns are
associations to defend liberal education, like the
just-mentioned [Council of Independent
Colleges](http://www.cic.edu/About-CIC/Pages/default.aspx),
or the [Association of American Colleges and
Universities](https://www.aacu.org/about), or the
[Association for General and Liberal
Studies](http://www.agls.org/AboutUs.htm), or the
[Association for Core Texts and
Courses](http://www.coretexts.org/), or the [American
Academy for Liberal
Education](http://www.aale.org/index.php/about-aale/mission).
There are so many defenders of liberal education, in fact,
that you can even find
[think-pieces](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/19/liberal-arts-colleges-rethink-their-messaging-face-criticism)
pondering why they seem to have failed, since liberal
education remains in peril.

But what if the defenders have succeeded---by putting
liberal education in peril? What if the threat to liberal
education comes from within? This is my worry. Let the idea
of a liberal art, for the moment, simply mean whatever it is
that distinguishes a liberal education from any other form
of education---a technical education, say. What if our many
defenses of liberal education have made us forget this idea?
What if the idea of a liberal art is lost?

<!--Perhaps use "lost" near the end, when
speaking of how we place liberal education in the world.-->

<!--Also, perhaps make clear later how to lose the idea of a liberal
art is the lose the distinction between a liberal education and
any other form of education.-->

## Part One

Now in one sense, I think, the threat to liberal education
must always come from within. The fate of liberal education,
after all, will not be decided in headlines, but in
choices made by each of us about the best education, once
education matters. Not the best education, then, in general,
as such, *per se*; but the best education for my daughter,
or my son, or me. In having to make such choices, those
devoted to liberal education are no different from those
dismissive of it.  And in this respect, the threat to
liberal education can never lie outside it. To pursue an
education at all, liberal or no, is to have answered
a question that a liberal education obliges each of us to
ask, and ask on our own behalf: What does it mean to be
educated? And we might well answer this question in a choice
*against* liberal education, even at the risk of its
extinction, if the same choice is made repeatedly. But this
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the question is
real, and the threat to liberal education therefore
intrinsic to it. The death of liberal education, so
understood, would similarly come from within, in a proof of
its life, and perhaps the only proof of life.

But again, those of us devoted to liberal education are
unlikely to want this death, especially just to show we were
devoted to something rather than nothing. And while the
threat may be internal in this general sense, it is still
external, I think, in a specific sense.
For if the threat to liberal education does come from
within, in a question it would have us ask for ourselves
about what it means to be educated, then while we may well
answer this question in a choice against liberal education,
we may also answer the question otherwise, by choosing
liberal education. Liberal education would then be a second
answer to the question, opposed to the first. And insofar as
one answer opposes the other, the threat to liberal
education would be external. 

But if the threat *is* external, as one answer opposed to
another, then one thing, I think, can be inferred about any
defense of liberal education against this threat. It will
have to convince us that liberal education *does* provide an
answer, even for those who give a different answer. It will
have to show us that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, whatever might be gained; and that the
answer we give in such a choice, even if it turns out right,
risks being wrong. And showing this much, it seems, means
showing there is something learned in liberal education,
that would otherwise go unlearned. To show, in short, that
liberal education has a subject-matter. Or, in a word:
content. <!--Later, give more simple description of problem:
that not having content means not being an answer to the
question.-->

But what, then, *is* this content? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone? Traditionally, the
content of a liberal education was identified with
a curriculum of seven liberal arts, a so-called *trivium* of
grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and a *quadrivium* of
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Each of these
arts was thought to wed a skill to a subject. And
together, these arts were thought to form a whole. This is
why one could say there was *something* to learn in
a liberal education, rather than many things, or anything,
or nothing. This is also what I want to say is contained in
the idea of a liberal art: a skill wedded to a subject, in
a whole of such skills and subjects, that gives a liberal
education its content. 

But one might also suspect that a liberal education has no
content in this sense, and that the liberal arts as
traditionally conceived show us why. They were learned,
after all, by the few rather than the many---the leisured
few, in that sense already free from servitude. Perhaps the
education they received was 'liberal,' then, not in
liberating them, but in shaping them, stamping them, and
perpetuating them. And the same might be suspected of any
content. For in what sense could we be freed by it, rather
than bound to it? What distinguishes content, so-called,
from dogma, or doctrine? What keeps it from closing the mind
that a truly liberal education is meant to open? 

This suspicion of content can also come from the opposite
direction, so to speak: by what we take to threaten liberal
education, or indeed any form of education. For leaving
headlines aside, this threat can seem to reflect a kind of
triumph of content over context, from college rankings and
scorecards at the start, to tests and grades at the end,
making the very meaning of education a matter of data-driven
results; and a choice against liberal education the answer
to a question never asked. Or we might conceive this threat
in economic terms, reducing education to just another
a product with a price in the global marketplace. Against
all this, the first thing we might think to say in defense
of education is that products are not enough, results are
not enough, answers are not enough, content is not enough. 

Defenses of liberal education, accordingly, have generally
made education a matter of context rather than content. And
the most common way of doing this is to locate learning not
in a set of subjects, but instead in the self. Thus it is
said that "the maturation of the student---not information
transfer---is the real purpose of colleges and
universities."[^NelsonInfoTransfer] Or that "if we are to
navigate skillfully the turbulent changes of the
twenty-first century, we must educate students not only to
process information effectively, but to think wisely and
well."[^Creighton]

[^NelsonInfoTransfer]:<http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/12/11/looking-value-college-wrong/>
[^Creighton]:<https://www.mtholyoke.edu/joannecreighton/article_liberal99>

And talk of turbulent changes points to another way that
defenses of liberal education have made it a matter of
context: by locating the self in an ever-changing world.
[A good 
example](http://www.sjc.edu/files/8013/9593/4530/league-of-women-voters-2011.pdf)
comes from an address by President Nelson: 

> With boundaries among the disciplines vanishing, with job
requirements and needs changing rapidly, we need citizens
prepared for change, prepared to adapt to jobs that do not
yet exist, prepared to enter an unknown world with a kind of
fearless determination to undertake whatever is required to
succeed. We will need skills of inquiry to enter a world we
cannot yet even envision.

We can begin to see from this quote why making liberal
education a matter of context rather than content, means
forgetting, more or less deliberately,  the idea of
a liberal art. For suppose we did live in a world that
changes more than it abides, where our freedom, to the
extent this depended on skill, were a matter of adaptation
more than application. <!--Later correct this as a world
that doesn't change, because the truth doesn't change.-->
Any art that deserved the name 'liberal', in that case,
would involve a skill more likely divorced from any subject
than wedded to one; which is to say, a skill that can be
applied to many subjects, even to every subject. And suppose
the number of such subjects to have multiplied past
counting, in one way the world indeed seems to have changed,
since the advent of modern science. <!--Perhaps allude to
this later. Modern science produces diversity; ancient
science a totality.--> If the liberal arts could still be
said to encompass a set of subjects, then it would seem
better understood as a diversity than as a totality.   

So once defenses of liberal education make it a matter of
context, it is unsurprising that they separate its skills
from its subjects.  The subjects, if they are specified at
all, are specified to give an impression of breadth, as if
there were many things one might learn in a liberal
education rather than just one. The current St. John's
website, for example,
[speaks](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts)
of the college's "wide-ranging, interdisciplinary
curriculum," where "areas of study include philosophy,
literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and
languages." Other lists of subjects are even more expansive.
One from the earlier-mentioned *Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign [makes it
sound](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
as if you might study anything:  

> You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors
that are included in the liberal arts. They include much
more than studio art and English classes (though those are
great!)---they range from mathematics to Mandarin, from
statistics to sociology. At liberal arts colleges and
universities students can study the sciences---such as
biology, chemistry, and physics---and social
sciences---including economics, political science, and
psychology. Students can study newer subjects, such as
environmental science and neuroscience, and traditional
ones, too.

This same impression of breadth is given in the way defenses
of liberal education present its skills apart from subjects.
You can indeed learn anything, then, in learning *how* to
learn. And this encompasses a range of skills similarly
presented apart from subjects: how to read, how to write,
how to speak, even how to think.[^ZakariaEarthly] St. John's
current way of putting this is [to
claim](<http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/>) that its
students "learn to speak articulately, read attentively,
reason effectively, and think creatively."

[^ZakariaEarthly]: For a typical example of this see
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fareed-zakaria/fareed-zakaria-liberal-arts-education_b_5380896.html>

In a similar vein, defenses of liberal education will call
the liberal arts "transferable skills," [^transferable],
again against the backdrop of an ever-changing job market.
And "usefulness" has become a ubiquitous word to counter
the opinion, and the traditional conviction, that the
liberal arts are useless. <!--Bring "useless" back up
later, and give a defense of it--> It is more generally the
habit in defenses of liberal education to talk of the
liberal arts as if they empowered us rather than enlightened
us---the aforementioned [*Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign](http://www.liberalartspower.org/Pages/default.aspx)
being the most explicit example.

[^Linker]: "How can liberal education be saved? By becoming truly, enduringly
useful." <>

[^transferable]: "Although modern liberal arts curriculums have an updated
choice of a larger range of subjects, it still retains the
core aims of the liberal arts curricula maintained by the
medieval universities: to develop well-rounded individuals
with general knowledge of a wide range of subjects and with
mastery of a range of transferable skills. They will become
‘global citizens’, with the capacity to pursue lifelong
learning and become valuable members of their communities."
<http://www.topuniversities.com/blog/what-liberal-arts-education>

There are deeper strains in this line of defense, that
try to reach beyond a liberal education's usefulness for any
career, to the way it might be useful for life, making the
self, in sense, the subject of its skills. A liberal arts
education can be "truly, enduringly useful," so [one
recent 
defense puts
it](http://theweek.com/articles/559681/how-save-liberal-arts-education),
once it is "oriented
towards the question of how to live." Or as President Nelson [has
written](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2015/02/26/hiring-grads-whats-going-part-iv/): 

> The primary purpose of college---contrary to the opinion of
> hiring managers---is not to provide trained-up workers for
> business, nor even to provide young people with the skills
> needed to make a living. The primary purpose is to help
> young people develop the character and the judgment to
> shape a life worth living.

In these appeals to the way a life might be shaped, defenses
of liberal education might be said to deepen the sense in
which liberal education is a matter of context, not content,
by locating what is learned in a cultivated readiness for
the world, whatever the world may hold. Here is how a recent
St. John's graduate puts it: 

> After my two-year commitment with Teach For America,
I hope to continue my work in the field of education. But
really, I can do anything. St. John’s has given me the
tools: the ability to listen, to think, to speak, to write,
and ultimately, to act. I need only to decide where to
direct my passion, and the world is mine, thanks to the
incredible education I have had the blessing to receive
here. [^Tyson]

[^Tyson]: <http://www.thejohnniechair.com/when-you-know-better-you-do-better-a-seniors-reflections-on-st-johns/> and parts quoted in <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-nelson/is-it-worth-it_1_b_3321206.html>

And there are ways to deepen this context still further; the
most common being to take this readiness for the
world as an openness to the world, whether the self so
opened is thought to be curious, inquisitive, imaginative,
self-critical, or sympathetic. Thus we find Martha Nussbaum,
to pick on a famous example, [defending liberal
education](http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0709s.pdf)
insofar as it develops[^Nussbaum]

1. The capacity for Socratic
self-criticism and critical thought about one's own traditions.
2. The ability to see oneself as a member of a heterogeneous nation
and world.
3. The ability to sympathetically imagine the lives of people different
from oneself.

[^Nussbaum]: A [later version](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9112.pdf)
of this list, from *Not for Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities* (p.7), reads:    
> 1. The ability to think critically;    
2. The ability to transcend local loyal­ ties and to approach world problems as a “citizen of the world."   
3. The ability to imagine sympathetically the predicament of another person.

And as suggested by Nussbaum's reference to Socrates, the
sense in which a truly liberal education opens minds rather
than closes them has particular appeal at St. John's, where
it would now sound antiquated to claim, as Scott Buchanan
did in the first catalog of the New Program, that the
liberal arts put us in possession of the truth.[^Buchanan]
What we say instead is self-consciously Socratic. Thus President 
Nelson will say that "liberal education is the best and
quickest way to become comfortable not
knowing."[^Nelson_comfort] Or that "learning is grounded in recognition and
acceptance of one’s own ignorance."[^Nelson_ignorance]
Or as the same St. John's
graduate I quoted earlier puts it: 

> I have learned that great questions lead to more and more
questions, not necessarily to answers, and I have learned
that the greatness of the human spirit shows itself in just
this realization. As Socrates says in Plato’s *Meno*: “We
shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think
that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we
indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no
use in seeking to know what we do not know.” We must have
intellectual bravery, that is, the courage to push forward,
to continue seeking truth even in the face of doubts about
its very existence.[^Tyson]

[^Buchanan]: "The arts of apprehending, understanding, and knowing the
truth are the liberal arts, and they set their own ends."
(*Bulletin of St. John's College in Annapolis, 1937--38*).

[^Nelson_comfort]: <http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/10/20/knowing-learn/>

[^Nelson_ignorance]: <http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/11/10/accountability-commodifying-examined-life/> 

A final example in this vein comes from the announcement for
a conference on liberal education, held on the Santa Fe campus
last year, where Socratic inquiry is put at the center of what
we do, and the liberal arts mentioned only in passing.

> At St. John’s College, it has continued to be our
> conviction that the root questions of life can be taken up
> by any serious person. We have made the Socratic
> approach---of open, courageous, and philosophically minded
> inquiry---central to the work of every class. We welcome
> friends (and critics) and educators from near and far to
> join us for this conference, which we envision as a broad
> platform to speak about the challenges and opportunities
> for liberal education today, and to engage in exemplary
> studies in the liberal arts (interpretive and substantive
> work on texts and within disciplines).[^SFConf]

[^SFConf]: <http://www.sjc.edu/programs-and-events/santa-fe/50th-anniversary-conference/>

It is this same Socratic approach that explains how St.
John's can make even an all-required program of books, which
might thought inescapably full of content, into a matter of
context. For anything written down, we might claim, is
simply doctrine, until a reader puts it into dialogue by
questioning it rather than assimilating it. And underlying
this shift from doctrine to dialogue is perhaps the deepest
belief one can have about a truly liberal education: that we
are only able to learn, truly learn, insofar as we do this
for ourselves. It would seem to follow directly from this
that *what* we learn is found indeed in the self, or even
the soul, rather than in a set of subjects. And the more
liberal an education becomes, so we could say, the more that
*what* we learn is a matter of *how* we learn, and *who* we
become in learning it. Which at this college, at least,
means the more that any so-called subject is found in
a book, which is found in a reader of that book, who is
found in a conversation about that book, which brings the
book to life, with all it may contain. And this
conversation, both with others and with oneself, might then
be said to exemplify the sense in which a liberal education
is finally a matter of context rather than content. For this
is an education in selfhood rather than subjects, where the
something we finally learn is what it means to learn, and
even what it means to love it.   

The suspicion that a truly liberal education has no content,
then, can be cast in terms that encompass what many of us,
I think, might say a liberal education finally is, and where
any appeal to a number of liberal arts seems beside the
point. St. John's even tried dropping any reference to the
liberal arts, along with any mention of liberal education,
when it first launched its new website. And it did this,
I think, to locate the place of a liberal education in the
present rather than the past. It was only a matter of months
before the college restored these references to its website,
since there were prospective students still using such terms
to find such things. But St. John's has otherwise remained
embarked, like seemingly every other liberal arts college in
the country, on a communications project carried out in
images rather than text, in the attempt not simply to say
what a liberal education is, but to show it, and capture
something about the *experience* of a liberal education when
mere explanations are thought no longer enough. Gone are the
days when the college could package its education, as it
were, in a brown paper wrapper, as if the education were not
only a matter of content, but the kind of content that
couldn't be seen from outside. Even the first video St.
John's made of itself, back in 1954(?), was mostly staged
and performed in vignettes, retaining at least that much
separation from the ongoing world. But it is just this
separation that is now deemed better erased than preserved,
leading to efforts that range from the Summer Academy to the
college's Instagram feed, as if to give the impression that
what separates the college from the outside world is only
a window, and a window more often open than shut. At its
worst, this project might be said to pander or flatter
rather than inform or educate; but at its best, it might be
said to make St. John's finally look like a college rather
than a cult. Or to put the sense of this strategy more
generally: to defend liberal education by locating the place
of liberal education *in* the world rather than apart from
it. ---Which is perhaps the most visible way that a liberal
education is now being made a matter of context rather than
content. 

## Part Two

By this point in my lecture, however, I think one could make
an objection. For I haven't yet given any grounds for
*worrying* about any of this. If we *have* lost the idea of
a liberal art, by making liberal education a matter of
context rather than content, then at most all I have shown
so far is that we have lost this idea deliberately, in what
might be called *an act* of forgetting. So let me now
explain my worry, which the rest of the lecture will try to
justify. My worry is that in losing this idea, more or less
deliberately, we risk another loss beyond our control: which
is to lose any way of giving a clear and compelling answer
to the question of what it means to be educated. ---Which is
to say, an answer that distinguishes liberal education from
any other form of education; and that sheds any light, then,
on what is lost in a choice against liberal education,
whatever might be gained. I worry, then, that once the idea
of a liberal art is lost in defense of liberal education,
the defense is lost. And once the defense is lost, liberal
education is lost.  

To begin to see all this, I want now to revisit the various
ways that defenses of liberal education have made it a matter
of context. For example: the basic set
of skills, again separated from subjects, that defenses of
liberal education claim are imparted by it. There is no doubt
that learning how to learn, along with how to read, write,
speak, and think, are useful skills; and one might even
grant their necessity for a life lived in freedom. But it is
hard to see how these skills belong to a liberal education
rather than to any education. And the more indispensable
these skills sound, the harder it is to conceive them as
liberal rather than remedial. Shouldn't we already know how
to learn, and read, write, speak, and think, before we go to
college?

There are, of course, ways to specify such skills, but they
reflect another aspect of the problem. To recall St. John's
way of doing this, in a liberal education you learn how to
speak articulately, read attentively, reason effectively,
think creatively. But are we we then to believe that you
will be left speaking inarticulately, reading inattentively,
reasoning ineffectively, or thinking uncreatively, if you
choose another kind of education---say, to pursue a degree
in computer programming? The implication can seem not just
incredible, but insulting; and it risks the very elitism
that made sense of losing the traditional idea of a liberal
art in the first place. Or perhaps nothing is meant against
another form of education when it is said what you can learn
in a liberal education. But if so, then what again
distinguishes a liberal education from any education? 

The same problem emerges from the attempt to distinguish
a liberal education on higher-sounding grounds. In [one of
his
blogposts](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/03/11/five-reasons-to-attend-st-johns-college/?_ga=1.184745897.1475954775.1399757768),
for example, President Nelson writes: "St. John’s College is
the right fit for someone who is seeking a special sort of
education---an education in the arts of freedom, an
education in how to make learning and life their own." But
one could ask how such encompassing terms could distinguish
a St. John's education from any education, or even from
human experience as such. For isn't the distinction between
experience and innocence, or experience and endurance, found
exactly in the kind of learning, and living, that is
necessarily one's own? Or suppose we take our bearings from
Socrates, and claim that St. John's will teach you
intellectual courage: how to persevere in the pursuit of
knowledge rather than yield in the face of ignorance.
Perhaps St. John's will, but so then will any field of
research one might pursue, it could be argued, that relies
on science rather than superstition to reach its results.
And direct appeals to Socrates, as if the Enlightenment never
happened, won't be enough to distinguish St. John's in
particular, or liberal education more generally, on the
matter of intellectual courage. 

But there is a whole other side to this problem. Insofar as
it becomes hard to distinguish a liberal education from any
education when it is made a matter of context, it becomes
easy to make a choice against liberal education merely by
wanting an education with content. To consider this problem
from one angle, take the the penchant in education for
testing and ranking and training and specializing. It may be
necessary to speak against all of this in defense of liberal
education, but it also risks the
impression that a liberal education is an education for
dilettantes, providing an escape from being challenged or
judged or driven or dedicated. And what can be said to
correct this impression, if in a liberal education, these
virtues are matters of context rather than content? Matters,
that is, about which nothing more can be said, but only
shown---where you see such students for yourself? Or even be
such a student yourself?---as one noted defender of liberal
education, Andrew Delbanco, [puts
it](http://chronicle.com/article/College-at-Risk/130893/),
when he writes:

> One of the difficulties in making the case
for liberal education against the rising tide of skepticism
is that it is almost impossible to persuade doubters who
have not experienced it for themselves. The Puritan founders
of our oldest colleges would have called it "such a mystery
as none can read but they that know it."

This way of putting the problem captures what is potentially
self-defeating in defenses of liberal education that make it
a matter of context. For if the point of any defense is *to
persuade* people to experience liberal education for
themselves, then how can there be a defense that depends on
such an experience to be persuasive?   

There are, of course, ways of trying to capture this
experience in images, as I earlier discussed in the case of
St. John's. But this same case reflects the problem. If we
make its education a matter of context, in images of
students playing croquet, or reading a book on a bench near
a tree, or even speaking with passion and eloquence about
how much their education means, we haven't yet distinguished
St. John's from any other college where such things might be
said or done---even though St. John's is unique, in having
renounced the elective system and established an
all-required curriculum. But St. John's is unique, then,
as a matter of content, not context. And something
similar by way of distinction-erasing might be said of
defenses of liberal education more generally. For if these
defenses were also the products of a liberal education, one
might have expected them to reflect a diversity of views, or
an originality of thought. But so far as these defenses make
liberal education a matter of context, and speak of the kind
of skills one needs to flourish in life, it becomes hard not
to speak in platitudes or commonplaces; and indeed these
defenses follow a kind of script: In an ever-changing world,
now more than ever, we need the truly useful arts of
a liberal education. Even President Nelson hasn't quite
managed to liberate himself from this script, even though
I regard him as a gifted writer---certainly the best I've
read among college presidents---who is making the most,
I think, of the script.   

Still, I suspect that those of us devoted to liberal
education will indeed need more than a script to survive.
And if my lecture so far is right, this means finding what
we have lost, or recollecting what we have forgotten. So in
the time I have left, I want to sketch out one path of
thought back to the idea of a liberal art. And for the first
step in this path, I want you to imagine that we shut the
window of St. John's College and draw the curtain, as if the
place of a liberal education were not within the world but
apart from it. Why would we do this? We would do it,
I think, because of how we understood the freedom promised
by a liberal education. We would take it to be important
enough, yet fragile enough, to protect its pursuit.  It
would be the kind of freedom, then, that we regard as
invaluable, but not indispensable: a life could be lived,
and even lived well, without it. Which is why the pursuit of
this freedom would need protection from the ongoing world.
For it might be forgotten in the living of life, or even
dismissed, or denied---for example, in the choice of another
form of education. 

But what kind of freedom could we dispense with in the
living of life? A freedom, I think, that transcends the
horizons of life, and indeed *is* a kind of freedom, and
perhaps the highest kind of freedom, in being without
horizons. And while there are other ways, perhaps, to
describe what it might mean to be without horizons, for the
rest of my sketch, I will describe this in the simplest way
I know: being without horizons means being in the truth.

Bring up Thomas Aquinas. Then Santayana as one piece of
Rhetoric from an Atheist. Then Ptolemy, liberal art, back
to discussion of Meno. I think we would have three good
reasons for doing this, all in light of what we took the
freedom promised by a liberal education to be. This freedom,
we would be saying, is not found at the beginning of an
education but at the end, that it is the kind of freedom to
transform the student who undergoes it, and that it is both
important enough, yet fragile enough to protect. One would
be that we takeWhy would we do such a thing? I think we
would have three good reasons for this. One would be to say 

A first reason for suspecting we *are* lost comes from one
thing that allowed me to write Part One of my lecture. For
I could not have talked about what is typical in current
defenses of liberal education, if they reflected a diversity
of views, or originality of thought. That is: if they
reflected what they claim is learned in a liberal education.
But what distinguishes these defenses most is how they
follow a kind of unquestioned script, and seem reduced to
this script once there is little to say on liberal
education's behalf by way of content. In an ever-changing
world, so the script runs, now more than ever, we need the
truly useful skills of a liberal education. And if you say
this when you're a dean, or a president, or otherwise
well-placed, and as if you were the first to say it rather
than merely the latest, then you're likely to be heard as
a defender of liberal education; and if you're someone else,
saying something else, by way of question or challenge or
counter, you're just as likely to be ignored.[^McClay 2] The
closing of ranks on this even put St. John's in the awkward
position, during the time it dropped any reference to the
liberal arts, of seeming to dismiss those who would question
the script while embracing those who could polish the
script, as if its education were Sophistic rather than
Socratic.[^McClay] Perhaps this could all be excused if the
script were working; but again, there is no evidence that it
has. And I'll be giving more reasons presently for why it
shouldn't. But even without these reasons, it is hard,
I think, to explain a defense of liberal education that
seems not to be a product of liberal education, save by
something closer to self-ignorance than to self-knowledge.   

[^McClay 2]: I owe a clarified sense of this script to an article by
B.D. McClay, "With Friends Like These." <http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/THR/2015/06/with-friends-like-these/>
[^McClay]: [Here's one 
example](http://spectator.org/articles/60752/defense-liberal-arts)
of what the college dismissed: 
> Even my own alma mater, St. John’s College, a liberal arts
college par excellence, has recently dropped both “liberal
arts” and “liberal education” from its own
self-description---which is a bit like the canary you brought
down into the coal mine drawing out a little pistol and
shooting itself in the head. St. John’s now speaks about an
education that develops “critical thinking and
collaboration”---good things, to be sure, but skills one can
learn behind that notorious Starbucks counter, where you’re
at least getting paid. Or, for that matter, in kindergarten.





Mention notion that St. John's was a cult, and problems of
initiation, but gerater point. What seems to have been
forgotten here is the original point of setting a liberal
education part. Education was once regarded as a serious
enough thing, but also fragile enough thing, to be set apart
from the ongoing world rather than anchored there. And the
freedom involved was at the end of the education, in a mode
of self-transformation rather than self-affirmation. And
self-transcendence. (use above): We have replaced this
package, ign is found in the images The defense of liberal
education on the grounds of its usefulness rather than
uselessness, as if in a freedom for the world.  is perhaps
and its ends are anchored in the world. one of anchoring
liberal education in the world, against the traditional
notion that it stood apart from the world, and even aloof
from the world and even aloof. to make the experience of
a liberal education show and locating the place of liberal
education firmly *in* the world rather than at all apart
from it. This way of putting it, in fact, shows us the sense
in which the defenses of liberal education that I discussed
in Part One, in which it is by making liberal education And
indeed this might be said of the entire line of defense that
I described in Part One: that the defense makes liberal
education a matter of something other than content, by
making it a matter of context. And indeed the essential
gesture in defenses of liberal education, once content is
given up, might be described as contextualizing, where the
place of liberal education is located firmly in the world
rather than at all apart from it. The mantra of "usefulness"
in defenses is perhaps the most important sign of this
contextualizing, Sense of value of freedom, and nature of
freedom, goes hand in hand with its fragility. And if we can
be suspicious of content insofar as it binds us rather than
frees us, then it seems we can even more suspicious of
context, which arguably binds us by its very nature. And
I think it is on this very point that we can begin to find
something deeply misconceived in 

What liberal education frees us for has to survive the self if the self can
die for it, but this would suggest it is indeed a matter of subjects rather
than the self.
sk how
we are freed by content rather than bound to it, he same
suspicion that we might be bound to content rather than
freed by it, might be directed all the more to matters of
context, which are essentially bounded. it also defines such
defenses in a counter-triumph of context over content. against any impression that it stands apart from the
world.  or even aloof  attempt to anchor liberal education
makes sense to call defenses of liberal education then one
might characterize the defense as a triumph of context over
content, one way of characterizing these defenses, in light
of the second problem with context, is to make context
triumph over content. Which is to say: to present a liberal
education, increasingly, as if it were possible to
experience it for oneself. Or to put this still another way,
to root it in the world rather than separate it from the
world. , 

alike this: 
And if these
are matters of context rather than content, then the
impression of dilettantism can only be corrected, in effect,
by an invitation to campus. And what if the invitation is
declined?  But we
can recognize that this rejoinder, too, is not enough, and
even see that saying what more is needed, if this is
context, escapes being specified, in just the way it escapes
being captured in a data-driven result. Yet this can reduce
our defense of liberal education to something like
inarticulate pointing. And what if no one else turns around?
Or to put the problem with context more concretely, we can
speak with eloquence 

Described this as a liberation from content, but it can look more
like a flight from content.

 
that is, a defense of what truly binds us by way of context,
over what we merely suspect may bind us by way of content.Only so much that can be said about a liberal education; the
essence of it can only be shown. You have to see it for yourself.
Contextualization is like specification.


(Put after discussion of context.) More generally it seems as
if this entire line of defense risks falling apart as soon
as you take it seriously and not just rhetorically. 

Or perhaps this is not the implication (use this idea to transition
into how not having content risks not giving a real answer, but a fake one.)

The ever-changing world like an unexamined opinion.

Note: to be non-elistist is to include the slave-boy, not Meno.

In an ever-changing world, now more than ever, a liberal
arts education is needed, with its truly useful skills.

The more seriously you take its claims, the more empty they
seem.

Also, conversation may bring books to life, but the books give
the conversation a point.
