# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

## Introduction

<!--Perhaps replace "defenses" with "defenders" in much of what
follows-->

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal
Art," is meant to express a worry I have about the future of
liberal education. This puts me in a sizable club. To have
worries at all has become reflexive among those
of us in any way devoted to this education. And there is no
end these days, it seems, to prophecies, even
pronouncements, of death. Type the words "death of liberal
education" into Google, and you get back such headlines as

All these headlines, I think, have one thing in common.
While they may disagree about the threat to liberal
education, they agree in distinguishing liberal education
from the threat, as if the threat were external. The
headlines make you think something *else* is killing liberal
education, whether it be liberals or conservatives or
technology or the economy. And it is hard to envision
a defense of liberal education without such a distinction,
even if headlines draw it simplistically, or even
inaccurately. For if liberal education itself were somehow
the threat, then death might well be liberal education's
best defense, but in defeat. No surprise, then, that those
of us devoted to liberal education are wont to conceive its
threats as if they came from outside it. For this justifies
a defense that succeeds only if liberal education survives.

And there is no shortage of such defenses. Type the words
"defense of liberal education" into Google, and you will
find one, it seems, for every headline predicting the death
of liberal education. And not just in articles. There are
books to defend liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There are blogs to defend liberal education, including [one
at St. John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/)
featuring regular posts by Christopher Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] There are campaigns to defend liberal
education, with slogans like *Securing America's Future: The
Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention just [one
initiative](http://www.cic.edu/Research-and-Data/Liberal-Arts/Campaign/Pages/default.aspx),
launched in 2012 by the Council of Independent
Colleges.[^campaigns] And behind these campaigns are
associations to defend liberal education, like the
just-mentioned [Council of Independent
Colleges](http://www.cic.edu/About-CIC/Pages/default.aspx),
or the [Association of American Colleges and
Universities](https://www.aacu.org/about), or the
[Association for General and Liberal
Studies](http://www.agls.org/AboutUs.htm), or the
[Association for Core Texts and
Courses](http://www.coretexts.org/), or the [American
Academy for Liberal
Education](http://www.aale.org/index.php/about-aale/mission).
There are so many defenders of liberal education, in fact,
that you can even find
[think-pieces](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/19/liberal-arts-colleges-rethink-their-messaging-face-criticism)
pondering why they seem to have failed, since liberal
education remains in peril.

But what if the defenders have succeeded---by putting
liberal education in peril? What if the threat to liberal
education comes from within? This is my worry. Let the idea
of a liberal art, for the moment, simply mean whatever it is
that distinguishes a liberal education from any other form
of education---a technical education, say. What if our many
defenses of liberal education have made us forget this idea?
What if the idea of a liberal art is lost?

This will be the proposal of my lecture tonight. In what
follows, I want to show how it is possible, even plausible,
to infer from current defenses of liberal education,
including those made at St. John's, that we have lost the
idea of a liberal art, and in a double sense. We have lost
it, first, in *an act* of forgetting; and second, in *a
state* of forgetting caused by the act. In the first sense
of forgetting, we would be in a condition of knowledge, more
or less, about what we have lost. And a case for this will
be made in the first half of my lecture. But in the second
sense of forgetting, we would be in a condition of ignorance
about what we have lost. And a case for this will be made in
the second half of my lecture. One way to speak of the two
senses together, in another formulation of the lecture's
proposal, and by way of concluding this introduction, is to
say that *we* are lost, once the idea of a liberal art is
lost. 

<!--Perhaps use "lost" near the end, when
speaking of how we place liberal education in the world.-->

<!--Also, perhaps make clear later how to lose the idea of a liberal
art is the lose the distinction between a liberal education and
any other form of education.-->

## Part One

Now in one respect, I think, the threat to liberal education
must always come from within. The fate of liberal education,
after all, will not be decided in headlines, but in
choices made by each of us about the best education, once
education matters. Not the best education, then, in general,
as such, *per se*; but the best education for my daughter,
or my son, or me. In having to make such choices, those
devoted to liberal education are no different from those
dismissive of it.  And in this respect, the threat to
liberal education can never lie outside it. To pursue an
education at all, liberal or no, is to have answered
a question that a liberal education obliges each of us to
ask, and ask on our own behalf: What does it mean to be
educated? And we might well answer this question in a choice
*against* liberal education, even at the risk of its
extinction, if the same choice is made repeatedly. But this
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the question is
real, and the threat to liberal education therefore
intrinsic to it. The death of liberal education, so
understood, would similarly come from within, in a proof of
its life, and perhaps the only proof of life.

But again, those of us devoted to liberal education are
unlikely to want this death, especially just to show we were
devoted to something rather than nothing. And while the
threat may be internal in this general sense, it is still
external, I think, in a more specific sense.
For if the threat to liberal education does come from
within, in a question it would have us ask for ourselves
about what it means to be educated, then while we may well
answer this question in a choice against liberal education,
we may also answer the question otherwise, by choosing
liberal education. Liberal education would then be a second
answer to the question, opposed to the first. And insofar as
one answer opposes the other, the threat to liberal
education would be external. 

But if the threat *is* external, as one answer opposed to
another, then one thing, I think, can be inferred about any
defense of liberal education against this threat. It will
have to convince us that liberal education *does* provide an
answer, even for those who give a different answer. It will
have to show us that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, whatever might be gained; and that the
answer we give in such a choice, even if it turns out right,
risks being wrong. And showing this much, it seems, means
showing there is something learned in liberal education,
that would otherwise go unlearned. To show, in short, that
liberal education has a subject-matter. Or, in a word:
content. <!--Later, give more simple description of problem:
that not having content means not being an answer to the
question.-->

But what, then, *is* this content? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone? Traditionally, the
content of a liberal education was identified with
a curriculum of seven liberal arts, a so-called *trivium* of
grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and a *quadrivium* of
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Each of these
arts was thought to wed a skill to a subject. And
together, these arts were thought to form a whole. This is
why one could say there was *something* to learn in
a liberal education, rather than many things, or anything,
or nothing. This is also what I want to say is contained in
the idea of a liberal art: a skill wedded to a subject, in
a whole of such skills and subjects, that gives a liberal
education its content. 

But one might also suspect that a liberal education has no
content in this sense, and that the liberal arts as
traditionally conceived show us why. They were learned,
after all, by the few rather than the many---the leisured
few, in that sense already free from servitude. Perhaps the
education they received was 'liberal,' then, not in
liberating them, but in shaping them, stamping them, and
perpetuating them. And the same might be suspected of any
content. For in what sense could we be freed by it, rather
than bound to it? What distinguishes content, so-called,
from dogma, or doctrine? What keeps it from closing the mind
that a truly liberal education is meant to open? 

This suspicion of content can also come from the opposite
direction, so to speak: by what we take to threaten liberal
education, or indeed any form of education. For leaving
headlines aside, along with the proposal of my lecture, this
threat can seem to reflect a kind of triumph of content over
context, from college rankings and scorecards at the start,
to tests and grades at the end, making the very meaning of
education a matter of data-driven results; and a choice
against liberal education the answer to a question never
asked. Or we might conceive this threat in economic terms,
reducing education to just another a product with a price in
the global marketplace. Against all this, the first thing we
might think to say in defense of education is that products
are not enough, results are not enough, answers are not
enough, content is not enough. 

Defenses of liberal education, accordingly, have generally
made education a matter of context rather than content. And
perhaps the most common way of doing this is to locate
learning not in a set of subjects, but instead in the self.
Here are two examples of this, the first from an address by
Christopher Nelson: 

> The maturation of the student---not
information transfer---is the real purpose of colleges and
universities. Of course, information transfer occurs during
this process. One cannot become a master of one’s own
learning without learning something. But information
transfer is a corollary of the maturation process, not its
primary purpose.[^NelsonInfoTransfer]


> If we are to navigate skillfully the turbulent changes of
the twenty-first century, we must educate students not only
to process information effectively, but to think wisely and
well. To my mind, nothing fosters that end better than
a liberal arts education.[^Creighton]

[^NelsonInfoTransfer]:<http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/12/11/looking-value-college-wrong/>
[^Creighton]:<https://www.mtholyoke.edu/joannecreighton/article_liberal99>

The talk of turbulent changes in the second quote points to
still another way that defenses of liberal education have
made it a matter of context: by locating the self in an
ever-changing world. Here is one example of this, again from
an address by Chris Nelson: 

Here is [one
example](http://www.sjc.edu/files/8013/9593/4530/league-of-women-voters-2011.pdf)
from an address by Chris Nelson: 

> With boundaries among the disciplines vanishing, with job
requirements and needs changing rapidly, we need citizens
prepared for change, prepared to adapt to jobs that do not
yet exist, prepared to enter an unknown world with a kind of
fearless determination to undertake whatever is required to
succeed. We will need skills of inquiry to enter a world we
cannot yet even envision.

We can also begin to see from this quote why making liberal
education a matter of context rather than content, means
forgetting, in effect, the idea of a liberal art. For
suppose we did live in a world that changes more than it
abides, where our freedom, to the extent this depended on
skill, was a matter of adaptation more than application.
<!--Later correct this as a world that doesn't change, 
because the truth doesn't change.--> Any art
that deserved the name 'liberal', in that case, would
involve a skill more likely divorced from any subject than
wedded to one; which is to say, a skill that can be applied
to many subjects, even to every subject, in a kind of
liberation from content. And suppose the number of such
subjects to have multiplied past counting, in one way the
world indeed seems to have changed, since the advent of
modern science. <!--Perhaps allude to this later. Modern
science produces diversity; ancient science a totality.--> If
the liberal arts could still be said to encompass a set of
subjects, then it would seem better understood as
a diversity than as a totality, in yet another liberation
from content.  

So once defenses of liberal education make it a matter of
context, it is unsurprising that they separate its skills
from its subjects, and in that sense forget the idea of
a liberal art. The subjects, if they are specified at all,
are specified to give an impression of breadth, as if there
were many things one might learn in a liberal education
rather than just one. The current St. John's website, for
example,
[speaks](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts)
of the college's "wide-ranging, interdisciplinary
curriculum," where "areas of study include philosophy,
literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and
languages." Other lists of subjects are even more expansive.
One from the earlier-mentioned *Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign [makes it
sound](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
as if you might study anything:  

> You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors
that are included in the liberal arts. They include much
more than studio art and English classes (though those are
great!)---they range from mathematics to Mandarin, from
statistics to sociology. At liberal arts colleges and
universities students can study the sciences---such as
biology, chemistry, and physics---and social
sciences---including economics, political science, and
psychology. Students can study newer subjects, such as
environmental science and neuroscience, and traditional
ones, too.

This same impression of breadth is given in the way defenses
of liberal education present its skills apart from subjects.
You can indeed learn anything, then, in learning *how* to
learn. And this encompasses a range of skills similarly
presented apart from subjects: how to read, how to write,
how to speak, even how to think.[^ZakariaEarthly] St. John's
current way of putting this is [to
claim](<http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/>) that its
students "learn to speak articulately, read attentively,
reason effectively, and think creatively."

[^ZakariaEarthly]: For a typical example of this see
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fareed-zakaria/fareed-zakaria-liberal-arts-education_b_5380896.html>

In a similar vein, defenses of liberal education will call
the liberal arts "transferable skills," [^transferable],
again against the backdrop of an ever-changing job market;
just as "usefulness" has become a ubiquitous word to counter
the opinion, and the traditional conviction, that the
liberal arts are useless.[^Linker]<!--Bring "useless" back up
later, and give a defense of it--> It is more generally the
habit in defenses of liberal education to talk of the
liberal arts as if they empowered us rather than enlightened
us---the aforementioned [*Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign](http://www.liberalartspower.org/Pages/default.aspx)
being the most explicit example.

[^Linker]: "How can liberal education be saved? By becoming truly, enduringly
useful." <http://theweek.com/articles/559681/how-save-liberal-arts-education>

[^transferable]: "Although modern liberal arts curriculums have an updated
choice of a larger range of subjects, it still retains the
core aims of the liberal arts curricula maintained by the
medieval universities: to develop well-rounded individuals
with general knowledge of a wide range of subjects and with
mastery of a range of transferable skills. They will become
‘global citizens’, with the capacity to pursue lifelong
learning and become valuable members of their communities."
<http://www.topuniversities.com/blog/what-liberal-arts-education>

To conceive a liberal art as a skill without a subject,
however, can make sense even if the world were
never-changing rather than ever-changing. For the difference
between learning *how* to think and learning *what* to
think, so we might say, is just the difference between being
educated and being indoctrinated.  Or to revert to an
earlier formulation of this: a truly liberal education is
meant to open minds rather than close them. And a deeper
vein in defenses of liberal education, again making it
matter of context, locates what is learned in a 
cultivated openness to the world, whether the self so opened
is thought to be curious, inquisitive, imaginative,
self-critical, or sympathetic. A well-known example of this
strain of defense comes from Martha Nussbaum, who typically
identifies what is learned in a truly liberal education with
the following three traits: [puts
this](http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0709s.pdf):[^Nussbaum]

1. The capacity for Socratic
self-criticism and critical thought about one's own traditions.
2. The ability to see oneself as a member of a heterogeneous nation
and world.
3. The ability to sympathetically imagine the lives of people different
from oneself.

[^Nussbaum]: A [later version](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9112.pdf)
of this list, from *Not for Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities* (p.7), reads:    
> 1. The ability to think critically;    
2. The ability to transcend local loyal­ ties and to approach world problems as a “citizen of the world."   
3. The ability to imagine sympathetically the predicament of another person.

But as her reference to Socrates in the first trait suggests,
this strain of defense has particular appeal and has gained
particular attraction at St. John's. Socrates 
For suppose our given condition---that is, our
uneducated condition---were to think we know when we don't.
Or suppose we had answers, in a sense, but to questions that
have been forgotten. The end of a liberal education would
then seem to lie in a recollection of questions; or
a knowledge of ignorance. Which is to say, in something less
like the learning of content, and more again like the
liberation from content.

And this is a third way that defenses of liberal education
make it a matter of something other than content: by
identifying learning with the act of questioning rather than
the act of answering. This is especially so at St. John's,
where it would sound antiquated to claim, as Scott Buchanan
did in the first catalog of the New Program, and on behalf
of a traditional conception of liberal arts, that these were
"the arts of apprehending, understanding, and knowing the
truth."[^Buchanan] What we say instead is self-consciously
Socratic; I give two recent examples of this, one from
a blogpost of Chris Nelson; the other from an address given
by a recent St. John's graduate:

> Liberal education is the best and quickest way to become
comfortable not knowing. By mastering a range of subject
matter that may not always be congenial, students are
repeatedly brought to the point of intellectual impasse. In
time, they become comfortable with their ignorance.[^Nelson_comfort]

> Before I came to the College, I read enthusiastically, yet
timidly. Now I read with fiercely inquisitive bravery.
I have learned that great questions lead to more and more
questions, not necessarily to answers, and I have learned
that the greatness of the human spirit shows itself in just
this realization. As Socrates says in Plato’s *Meno*: “We
shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think
that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we
indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no
use in seeking to know what we do not know.” We must have
intellectual bravery, that is, the courage to push forward,
to continue seeking truth even in the face of doubts about
its very existence.[^Tyson]

[^Buchanan]: "The arts of apprehending, understanding, and knowing the
truth are the liberal arts, and they set their own ends."
(*Bulletin of St. John's College in Annapolis, 1937--38*).

[^Nelson_comfort]: <http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/10/20/knowing-learn/>

A final example in this vein comes from the announcement for
a conference on liberal education, held on the Santa Fe campus
last year, where Socratic inquiry is put at the center of what
we do, and the liberal arts mentioned only in passing.

> At St. John’s College, it has continued to be our
> conviction that the root questions of life can be taken up
> by any serious person. We have made the Socratic
> approach---of open, courageous, and philosophically minded
> inquiry---central to the work of every class. We welcome
> friends (and critics) and educators from near and far to
> join us for this conference, which we envision as a broad
> platform to speak about the challenges and opportunities
> for liberal education today, and to engage in exemplary
> studies in the liberal arts (interpretive and substantive
> work on texts and within disciplines).[^SFConf]

[^SFConf]: <http://www.sjc.edu/programs-and-events/santa-fe/50th-anniversary-conference/>

It is this same Socratic approach that explains why an
all-required program of books, which might otherwise be
thought full of content, could more deeply be said to lack
it. For anything written down, we might claim, is simply
doctrine, until a reader puts it into dialogue, and by
questioning it rather than assimilating it. This brings us
to a final reason, then, we might wonder if a liberal
education has any content; and perhaps our best reason to
forget the idea of a liberal art. For suppose we were only
able to learn, truly learn, insofar as we did this for
ourselves. What we learned, in that case, would
seem to be found in the self, or even the soul, rather than
in a set of subjects. And this is the same self that
a liberal education makes free. So the more liberal an
education becomes, we might say, the more that *what* we
learn is a matter of *how* we learn, and *who* we become in
learning it. Which at this college, at least, is to say the
more that any so-called subject is found in a book, which is
found in a reader of that book, who is found in
a conversation about that book, which brings the book to
life, with all it may contain. And this conversation, both
with others and with oneself, might then be said to embody
a liberal education without content: an education in
selfhood rather than subjects, where the something we
finally learn is what it means to learn, and even what it
means to love it.   

The suspicion that a truly liberal education has no content,
then, can be cast in terms that encompass what many of us,
I think, might say a liberal education finally is, and where
any appeal to a number of liberal arts seems beside the
point. It is no surprise, then, that a final way defenses of
liberal education make it a matter of something other than
content is to identify its end with the self, and
a self ready for anything. Here is one example from the same
address by a recent St. John's graduate that I quoted just
above: 

> After my two-year commitment with Teach For America,
I hope to continue my work in the field of education. But
really, I can do anything. St. John’s has given me the
tools: the ability to listen, to think, to speak, to write,
and ultimately, to act. I need only to decide where to
direct my passion, and the world is mine, thanks to the
incredible education I have had the blessing to receive
here. [^Tyson]

[^Tyson]: <http://www.thejohnniechair.com/when-you-know-better-you-do-better-a-seniors-reflections-on-st-johns/> and parts quoted in <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-nelson/is-it-worth-it_1_b_3321206.html>

I can mention one last example in this vein, as a way to
conclude Part One of my lecture. For in wanting to capture
this kind of student voice on behalf of its education, St.
John's recently performed an experiment for several months, when it
launched its new website. And the experiment was to
describe itself without any mention of the liberal arts,
or even liberal education, as if in the deliberate attempt
to forget the whole idea. 


## Part Two

But this, again, would be to lose the idea knowingly. And it
is time to ask what it might mean to lose this idea
unknowingly. In what sense, then, might *we* be lost, once
the idea of a liberal art is lost? A first reason for
suspecting we *are* lost comes from one thing that allowed
me to write Part One of my lecture. For I could not have
talked about what is typical in current defenses of liberal
education, if they reflected a diversity of views, or
originality of thought. That is: if they reflected what they
claim is learned in a liberal education. But what
distinguishes these defenses most is how they follow a kind
of unquestioned script, and seem reduced to this script once
there is little to say on liberal education's behalf by way
of content. In an ever-changing world, so the script runs,
now more than ever, we need the truly useful skills of
a liberal education. And if you say this when you're a dean,
or a president, or otherwise well-placed, and as if you were
the first to say it rather than merely the latest, then
you're likely to be heard as a defender of liberal
education; and if you're someone else, saying something
else, by way of question or challenge or counter, you're
just as likely to be ignored.[^McClay 2] The closing of ranks on this
even put St. John's in the awkward position, during the time
it dropped any reference to the liberal arts, of seeming to
dismiss those who would question the script while embracing
those who could polish the script, as if its education were
Sophistic rather than Socratic.[^McClay] Perhaps this could
all be excused if the script were working; but again, there
is no evidence that it has. And I'll be giving more reasons
presently for why it shouldn't. But even without
these reasons, it is hard, I think, to explain
a defense of liberal education that seems not to be
a product of liberal education, save by something closer to
self-ignorance than to self-knowledge.   

[^McClay 2]: I owe a clarified sense of this script to an article by
B.D. McClay, "With Friends Like These." <http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/THR/2015/06/with-friends-like-these/>
[^McClay]: [Here's one 
example](http://spectator.org/articles/60752/defense-liberal-arts)
of what the college dismissed: 
> Even my own alma mater, St. John’s College, a liberal arts
college par excellence, has recently dropped both “liberal
arts” and “liberal education” from its own
self-description---which is a bit like the canary you brought
down into the coal mine drawing out a little pistol and
shooting itself in the head. St. John’s now speaks about an
education that develops “critical thinking and
collaboration”---good things, to be sure, but skills one can
learn behind that notorious Starbucks counter, where you’re
at least getting paid. Or, for that matter, in kindergarten.

But again, there *are* other reasons to worry that *we*
might be lost once the idea of liberal is lost. And one way
to frame them, for the rest of my discussion, is to ask this
question: what else might we have forgotten, in forgetting
the idea of a liberal art? One answer to this question,
which we might keep in mind for the rest of my discussion,
is that we have forgotten how to defend liberal education in
a way that can be taken seriously, rather than just
rhetorically. Or to put this in terms of my account in Part
One, we have forgotten how to show that liberal education
provides an answer to the question of what it means to be
educated, even for those who give a different answer. We
have forgotten how to show that something is lost in
a choice against liberal education, whatever might be
gained; and that the answer we give in such a choice, even
if it turns out right, risks being wrong. But I can put this
answer one final way, which will be my suggestion by the end
of Part Two: Once we forget the idea of a liberal art, we
forget what it means to be free. 

To begin to see all this, I want to return to the basic set
of skills, again separated from subjects, that it is claimed
a liberal education imparts. There is no doubt that learning
how to learn, along with how to read, write, speak, and
think, are useful skills; and one might even grant their
necessity for a life lived in freedom. But it is hard to see
how these skills belong to a liberal education rather than
to any education. And the more indispensable these skills
sound, the harder it is to conceive them as liberal rather
than remedial. Shouldn't we already know how to learn, and
read, write, speak, and think, before we go to college?

There are, of course, ways to specify such skills, but they
reflect another aspect of the problem. To recall St. John's
way of doing this, in a liberal education you learn how to
speak articulately, read attentively, reason effectively,
think creatively. But are we we then to believe that you
will be left speaking inarticulately, reading inattentively,
reasoning ineffectively, or thinking uncreatively, if you
choose another kind of education---say, to pursue a degree
in computer programming? The implication can seem not just
incredible, but insulting; and it risks the very elitism
that made sense of losing the idea of a liberal art as this
was traditionally conceived. Or perhaps nothing is meant
against another form of education when it is said what you
can learn in a liberal education. But if so, then what again
distinguishes a liberal education from any education? 

The same problem emerges from the attempt to distinguish
a liberal education on higher-sounding grounds. In [one of
his
blogposts](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/03/11/five-reasons-to-attend-st-johns-college/?_ga=1.184745897.1475954775.1399757768),
for example, Chris Nelson writes: "St. John’s College is the
right fit for someone who is seeking a special sort of
education---an education in the arts of freedom, an
education in how to make learning and life their own." But
in what sense, exactly, does this distinguish a St. John's
education from any education, or even from human experience
as such? For this would seem to be experience, rather than
innocence, or mere endurance, through the kind of learning,
and living, that is necessarily one's own. Or suppose we
follow the St. John's graduate I quoted in the first part of
my lecture, and claim that St. John's will teach you
intellectual courage: how to persevere in the pursuit of
knowledge rather than yield in the face of ignorance.
Perhaps St. John's will, but so then will any field of
research one might pursue, it could be argued, that relies
on science rather than superstition to reach its results.
And making references back to Socrates, as if the
Enlightenment never happened, won't be enough to distinguish
St. John's in particular, or liberal education more
generally, on the matter of intellectual courage. 

It would easy, of course, to distinguish a liberal education
from any education, if it could be said just what is
learned, or read, or written, or spoken, or thought, to
locate these skills in a liberal education alone. But to say
this much is just what defenses of liberal education refuse
to say, in wanting to claim the skills in question can be
applied to anything. And this suggests that once we forget
the idea of a liberal art, we forget how to distinguish
a liberal education from any education, or even from what
happens in human life regardless of education. 

But in forgetting this much, it seems we also then forget
how to show that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, since there is nothing to distinguish
a liberal education from any education. And since we are put
in this predicament by making liberal education a matter of
something other than content, we so risk making any *choice*
about education a matter of content, which makes a choice
against liberal education not just possible, but likely, at
for those who become serious about their education, and want
it to have content. I can use computer programming again as
an example of what I mean. *Bloomberg Businessweek* recently
published [a 38,000 word
essay](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
entitled "What is Code?." And if you read this essay, it is
hard to shake the impression that it makes more sense of
a liberal education than anything published in its defense.
This is not just because the writer of the essay knows how
to write, and proves it over the course of 38,000 words. It
is also because of what he is writing about, which starts to
sound like a true liberal art by the time he is through:
a skill, programming, wedded to a subject, code, that
encompasses a kind of whole in contemporary life. ---And
indeed the kind of whole in contemporary life---the essay
again appeared in *Businessweek*---that defenses of liberal
education will claim it best prepares its graduates for.
A serious high school student who read this essay might be
forgiven, then, if she concluded that a real college
education could be had by pursuing a programming degree, and
that making learning one's own means learning one thing
well. 

But this is just one example, and hypothetical at that, of
a more general, actual, and recognized problem. Consider the
way that defenders of liberal education are compelled to
speak against the penchant in education for testing and
ranking and training and specializing, declaring again that
content is not enough, against the seeming triumph of
content over context. They know this risks the impression
that a liberal education is an education for dilettantes,
providing an escape from being challenged or judged or
driven or dedicated. But what can be said to counter this
impression, if in a liberal education, these virtues are
matters of context rather than content? Which is to say,
matters about which nothing more can be said, but
only shown---where you see such students for yourself? Or
even be such a student yourself?---as one noted defender of
liberal education, Andrew Delbanco, [puts
it](http://chronicle.com/article/College-at-Risk/130893/),
when he writes:

> One of the difficulties in making the case
for liberal education against the rising tide of skepticism
is that it is almost impossible to persuade doubters who
have not experienced it for themselves. The Puritan founders
of our oldest colleges would have called it "such a mystery
as none can read but they that know it."

This way of putting the problem captures what is potentially
self-defeating in defenses of liberal education that make it
a matter of context rather than content. For if the point
of any defense is *to persuade* people to experience liberal
education for themselves, then how can there be a defense
that depends on such an experience to be persuasive?  

Defenses of education do attempt to address this, but one
could say it is by doubling down on context rather than
shifting to content, in the attempt not simply to say what
a liberal education is, but to show it. The most visible
sign of this is the images that you can find increasingly in
liberal arts college brochures and on websites, which being
images rather than text, can can better capture the
experience of a liberal education, when explanations of it
not enough. St. John's has its own striking history of this.
For not so long ago it packaged its education in a brown
paper wrapper---as if the education not only had content,
but the kind of content that couldn't be seen from outside.
Even the first video it made of itself, back in 1954, was
mostly staged, retaining at least that much separation from
the ongoing world. But it is just this separation that is
now deemed better erased than preserved; and communication
efforts at the college seem aimed at giving the impression
that what separates the college from the outside world is
merely a window, albeit a window that frames the
better-looking among us. This strategy also makes a kind of
sense, if we describe it as the attempt to allay any
suspicions that St. John's is less like a college and more
like a cult. Or to put the sense of this strategy more
generally: to defend liberal education by locating the place
of liberal education *in* the world rather than apart from
it. 



Mention notion that St. John's was a cult, and problems of
initiation, but gerater point. What seems to have been
forgotten here is the original point of setting a liberal
education part. Education was once regarded as a serious
enough thing, but also fragile enough thing, to be set apart
from the ongoing world rather than anchored there. And the
freedom involved was at the end of the education, in a mode
of self-transformation rather than self-affirmation. And
self-transcendence. (use above): We have replaced this
package, ign is found in the images The defense of liberal
education on the grounds of its usefulness rather than
uselessness, as if in a freedom for the world.  is perhaps
and its ends are anchored in the world. one of anchoring
liberal education in the world, against the traditional
notion that it stood apart from the world, and even aloof
from the world and even aloof. to make the experience of
a liberal education show and locating the place of liberal
education firmly *in* the world rather than at all apart
from it. This way of putting it, in fact, shows us the sense
in which the defenses of liberal education that I discussed
in Part One, in which it is by making liberal education And
indeed this might be said of the entire line of defense that
I described in Part One: that the defense makes liberal
education a matter of something other than content, by
making it a matter of context. And indeed the essential
gesture in defenses of liberal education, once content is
given up, might be described as contextualizing, where the
place of liberal education is located firmly in the world
rather than at all apart from it. The mantra of "usefulness"
in defenses is perhaps the most important sign of this
contextualizing, Sense of value of freedom, and nature of
freedom, goes hand in hand with its fragility. And if we can
be suspicious of content insofar as it binds us rather than
frees us, then it seems we can even more suspicious of
context, which arguably binds us by its very nature. And
I think it is on this very point that we can begin to find
something deeply misconceived in 

What liberal education frees us for has to survive the self if the self can
die for it, but this would suggest it is indeed a matter of subjects rather
than the self.
sk how
we are freed by content rather than bound to it, he same
suspicion that we might be bound to content rather than
freed by it, might be directed all the more to matters of
context, which are essentially bounded. it also defines such
defenses in a counter-triumph of context over content. against any impression that it stands apart from the
world.  or even aloof  attempt to anchor liberal education
makes sense to call defenses of liberal education then one
might characterize the defense as a triumph of context over
content, one way of characterizing these defenses, in light
of the second problem with context, is to make context
triumph over content. Which is to say: to present a liberal
education, increasingly, as if it were possible to
experience it for oneself. Or to put this still another way,
to root it in the world rather than separate it from the
world. , 

alike this: 
And if these
are matters of context rather than content, then the
impression of dilettantism can only be corrected, in effect,
by an invitation to campus. And what if the invitation is
declined?  But we
can recognize that this rejoinder, too, is not enough, and
even see that saying what more is needed, if this is
context, escapes being specified, in just the way it escapes
being captured in a data-driven result. Yet this can reduce
our defense of liberal education to something like
inarticulate pointing. And what if no one else turns around?
Or to put the problem with context more concretely, we can
speak with eloquence 

Described this as a liberation from content, but it can look more
like a flight from content.

 
that is, a defense of what truly binds us by way of context,
over what we merely suspect may bind us by way of content.Only so much that can be said about a liberal education; the
essence of it can only be shown. You have to see it for yourself.
Contextualization is like specification.


(Put after discussion of context.) More generally it seems as
if this entire line of defense risks falling apart as soon
as you take it seriously and not just rhetorically. 

Or perhaps this is not the implication (use this idea to transition
into how not having content risks not giving a real answer, but a fake one.)

The ever-changing world like an unexamined opinion.

Note: to be non-elistist is to include the slave-boy, not Meno.

In an ever-changing world, now more than ever, a liberal
arts education is needed, with its truly useful skills.

The more seriously you take its claims, the more empty they
seem.

Also, conversation may bring books to life, but the books give
the conversation a point.
