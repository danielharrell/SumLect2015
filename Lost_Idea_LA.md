# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

## Introduction

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art," is
meant as a suggestion, or hypothesis.  What I mean by this hypothesis
is best introduced, perhaps, if we consider a
[recent attempt](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
to answer the question: "What Are The Liberal Arts?"  Here is how the
answer starts:

> A liberal arts education means studying broadly---taking classes in
> many different subjects---and building skills that are geared toward
> more than just one profession.  By studying the liberal arts, students
> develop strong critical thinking, problem solving, and communication
> skills.  Liberal arts students learn to approach questions flexibly
> and to think across multiple disciplines.  These are skills employers
> say they value most, even more than a specific major.  **In today’s
> labor market, career paths are changing rapidly, and graduates must
> draw from a variety of skillsets to adapt to challenges and capitalize
> on opportunities.**

Already we might notice something getting lost in this answer.  True,
it speaks at comparative length of what can be gained by a study of
liberal arts.  But it says almost nothing about what they are.  The
answer so far, it seems, is simply "many different subjects."

But as I said, this is only the start of the answer.  The answer
continues like this:

>You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors that are
>included in the liberal arts.  They include much more than studio art
>and English classes (though those are great!)---they range from
>mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology.  At liberal arts
>colleges and universities students can study the sciences---such as
>biology, chemistry, and physics---and social sciences—including
>economics, political science, and psychology.  Students can study newer
>subjects, such as environmental science and neuroscience, and
>traditional ones, too.

The answer "many different subjects" is elaborated here.  ---But only,
it seems, by way of expansion, to encompass almost any subject you
could think of, or want to study.  We might wonder what *isn't* a
liberal art on this account.  For we have gotten no answer to the
question of what *is* one, which tells us what a liberal art finally
is, no matter how many there might be.  Or, to borrow a figure from
Plato's *Meno*, we could say we've been given a *swarm* of liberal
arts, when we might have wanted just one.  This would be the one that
makes any member of the swarm, indeed, a member.  What we would want,
in that case, might be called the *idea* of a liberal art.  And it
would be this idea, then, that has gotten lost in the answer above.  We
ask what the liberal arts are, and are given too many in reply to
know.

## Being lost on any list; one way to be lost

But how many are too many?  The list just given might seem too long,
or at least too indefinite.  Yet consider the most definitive list I
can think of, and the most likely one you already know of.  This is
the list we've inherited from medieval times, composed of seven
liberal arts: grammar, logic, and rhetoric; arithmetic, geometry,
music and astronomy.  No more, no fewer.  Yet what makes *these* the
liberal arts?  It would seem impossible to know, unless we have some
notion, or again *idea*, of what a liberal art is, to tell us.  And if
this idea is distinct from any example, it will not be found on any
list of examples, even if the seven on this list---definitive as it
is---exhaust the examples.  And not to be found is one way of
being lost.  So on this argument, the idea of a liberal art will be
lost on *any* list of them, no matter how short, or definite.

## Being forgotten; another way to be lost

Still, if we were persuaded by this argument, it seems we would shy away
from lists, or at least offer something more than lists, when trying to
say what a liberal art is.  But in general, we don't.  The list
I started with, for example, is again a recent one: part of an ongoing
campaign, begun in 2012, to promote the liberal arts by The Council of
Independent Colleges.[^1] And two more lists can be found on [the same
page](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/)
of the current St. John's website.  The first list has twelve items on
it: philosophy, literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and languages. And
the second list reduces this twelve to eight: music and literature,
philosophy and theology, history and social science, mathematics and
natural science.  There is nothing that accompanies either list to
explain why *these* are the liberal arts, or to explain why one list
differs from the other, or even to explain why both differ from the
medieval list you may recall.  And if you do recall the medieval list,
you likely recall little else.  Perhaps you remember that grammar,
logic, and rhetoric were grouped together in what was called
a *trivium*, and the rest in a *quadrivium*, but without any comparable
memory of why.  Or perhaps you remember that the word "art" in "liberal
art" means something like "skill," and "liberal" something like
"liberating," but without any comparable sense of what "a liberating
skill" means, or why it should be found in the study of arithmetic or
astronomy.  <!--Maybe mention definition in power of liberal arts page
only going this far.-->

So even if no list of liberal arts contains the idea of one among its
examples, such lists prevail, even in memory. And this suggests a deeper
way of being lost, where not being found means being forgotten. Hence my
lecture's title. In the lost idea of a liberal art, my hypothesis is
that we have indeed forgotten what a liberal art is. And by "we," I mean
those of us on the side of the liberal arts, so to speak. ---Those of us
who would defend them, rather than dismiss them, when talking about the
aims of education. And in this case those of us who would defend them
by drawing up lists of them. But we draw up our lists, on this hypothesis,
in having no idea of a liberal art to offer in their place.

(In this paragraph, give more evidence for hypothesis. There are several threads to sort out here. One, the fact that items on the later lists are not
defined, as they might be on the medieval list. In St. John's case this is
highlighted by the fact that we more or less forcibly apply the list to our
readings, and have done so since the time of Buchanan. Then lead to a clarification of the word "forgetting" as an act rather than a condition. How St. John's wanted to dispense with "liberal arts" reference; how "liberal education" can be talked about without any reference to "liberal arts" in general; how it serves as merely lip service. Then move to deeper issue of importance by talking about power. Also relate this to lack of content.)


the lists, on this hypothesis, are a
symptom of forgetfulness. we draw up our lists, on this hypothesis,
But again there is no idea of a liberal art to
be found on such lists; and on this hypothesis, this is *why* we resort
to lists. we draw up lists of them, on this hypothesis,draw up lists of them, whether to
promote the liberal arts generally, would draw up lists of them in the
attempt to and are wont to defend them, as in the cases just mentioned,
by drawing up lists of them. <(Perhaps put "by 'we" sentence up here.)
(Change this next sentence to: one sign of this is our resorting to
lists; but there are other signs. Then move on to other signs.) And this
is why we resort to lists of them, where no idea of one can be found.
(Need another sentence here.)

think of seven liberal arts, or eight, or twelve, or as many
as you please, because we lack any notion of a liberal art that might
reduce this many to one.

!--Previous sentence should be revised. Perhaps separate idea of
defense from merely drawing up lists.-->

<!--Another possible way to organize this: don't mention "we" until after
sentence about forgetting leading to resorting to lists. Explain "we" later,
as a challenge to hypothesis. How could "we" on the side of liberal arts
have forgotten what they are?-->

<!--Revise from here: put some sort of "by we, I mean" sentence first.
Then say this is why we resort to lists, etc. Then speak of purpose of
lecture as threefold: (1) To defend the hypothesis (2) Show why it matters
(3) What does recollection look like.-->
<!--Later speak of forgetting as an act rather than a state, or
condition.-->

To think of seven liberal arts on this
hypothesis, or eight, or twelve, or as many as you please, is not a
sign of comprehension but rather a surrogate for it. to recall any
number of liberal arts, whether this be seven, or eight, or twelve, or
indefinitely many, is not a sign of what we comprehend but rather a
surrogate for it. This hypothesis invites us to consider any such list
of liberal arts, whether it numbers seven, or eight, or twelve, or
indefinitely man a list of liberal arts, whether it numbers seven,
comprehension but rather a surrogate for it. We have no idea, on this
hypothesis, what a liberal art is; thus we resort to lists, where no
such idea can be found. of what a liberal art is, just as such; so we
resort to lists, where no such notion can be found.  or the sceond l.
who would defend rather than dismiss the liberal artswho might be
thought most devoted to the liberal arts: we students, and stewards,
of a liberal education. (A sentence here linking the "we" to the
purveyors of the lists above.) On this hypothesis, we have lost any
notion of what a liberal art is, just as such; and this is why we
resort to lists, where no such notion can be found. (Later speak of
how there are borrowings in current lists from current fields of
study.)

lists.  with the problem with our various lists of liberal arts is not

with Have the sentence here referring back to lists. On this
hypothesis, there is a false sense of comprehension in the lists of
liberal arts just mentioned, and a lack of insight , will see liberal
arts proliferate on lists, in ostensible defense Perhaps include a
sentence or two here about how this forgetfulness is manifest in the
seeming comprehension of lists. And by "forgotten," I not only mean in
the sense that the idea of a liberal art has vanished from our
thoughts about liberal education, as if by accident; I also mean in
the sense that this idea may have vanished in being banished, as if by
choice. The idea of a liberal art has become something to forget, on
this hypothesis, when we are called upon to explain, or defend, or
even pursue, a liberal education.

But then move to a still deeper sense
of loss, where the forgetting comes first. As a straightforward first
example, give the original version of new website. Then move on to subtler
examples in list, linked to power. But this, to my mind, is not yet the
deepest way of being lost, where being forgotten at once means not
being found. ---Which is to say, where being forgotten is not the
result of being lost, but rather the cause of it. This last sense of
"lost" may seem irrelevant to to the idea of liberal education, And
"forgotten" is what I mean by "lost" in my lecture's title. In the
lost idea of a liberal art, my hypothesis is that we have indeed
forgotten what a liberal art is. But it doesn't explain the
persistence. Which suggests a still deeper way of being lost. not the
result but rather of not being found. here we might say being
forgotten means not being found. (Need to expand this next section.)

of a liberal art is lost on any list not simply in not being found, but
in being forgotten.  a
liberal art is thereby lost not simply in not being found, but in
being forgotten.   twice over: once insofar as it can't be
found on any such list; and once again insofar as it is forgotten.
And by "forgotten," On
this hypothesis, we should take every list of liberal arts as a sign
of false comprehension.


It seems as if we can draw up our lists of liberal arts, and
recall them, without feeling the lack of definitions first.  suggests that the idea
of a liberal art is lost on any list not simply by not being found on
it, as if there is something memorable enough about a list of liberal
arts to obscure any like interest in a definition.  Obscures any
content.  For this paragraph: Thus we draw up our lists, and recall
them, without a thought for definitions first.  As if a list at once
obscures the idea while inducing forgetfulness.  (Perhaps mention
St.  John's original idea of getting rid of mentioning liberal arts
altogether.)  This suggests that the idea of a liberal art is lost on
any list not simply by not being found on it, but also by being
forgotten.  And this makes the task of this lecture one of
recollection, like the Meno.  But that had the advantage of discussing
virtue, inherently important.  How to make this topic also important?
By linking it to the Meno.)

both number and kind from the medieval one.  from the medieval one But
which list is the right list? Or at least, the more definitive list?
And does either list, since it differs from the medieval one, mean
that the liberal arts have changed since medieval times? Again, it
would seem that we cannot answer such questions unless we recover, or
we might even say *recollect*, the idea of a liberal art that goes
missing, or gets lost, so soon as we draw up our lists.

Or am I missing the point?  For perhaps there is no *one* list of the
liberal arts, or even competing lists, but rather many lists, even
indefinitely many.  Perhaps nearly any field of study, that is, can be
studied as a liberal art, if only it is studied in a certain way.  But
if so, then what is that way? In this case, too, it would seem that we
need the *idea* of a liberal art to know, making any mere list of them
beside the point.  Indeed, if we press the sense in which a liberal
art is, somehow, an *art*, which is to say, a certain way of doing
something, then we might think that both lists of liberal arts on the
St.  John's website miss the point.  For there we are, treating the
liberal arts as if they were subjects rather than activities.  S o we
draw up a list of such things as philosophy, or physics, or
mathematics, or languages; when we should really be speaking of such
things as conversation, demonstration, translation, experimentation.
But again, to decide whether we have thusly missed the point, it would
seem that we need some sense of what a liberal art is, which no such
list, right or wrong, can provide.

Similarly, if you have any memory of the medieval notion of a
liberal art, mention what we
remember from the medieval conception, which, if it goes beyond the
list, only extends perhaps to the trivium and quadrivium categories,
along with perhaps the sense that liberal arts are those arts, or ways
of doing something, that liberate us.  But none of this with any deeply
felt connection to what we do; then bring up the fact the website had
no reference to liberal arts.  Then move on to this as a different way
of being lost, forgotten, and two reasons for its importance: (1) that
the forgetfulness comes with a shift in the purpose of a liberal
education; and (2) that there is an issue of content.  (spell this
out.))

to promote the liberal arts, that began
in 2012.  : Why? This suggests another way, a deeper way, of being
lost.  But again, this is just one way of being lost.  It is also an
obvious way of being lost.  So why do lists of liberal arts persist.
Introduce another way of being lost.  If we at St.  John's were
convinced, we might feel obliged to define what we mean by a liberal
art.  (Perhaps we could say they are arts that "free" us; but we can
hear Socrates counter: what does "free" mean?)  If we---and by "we" I
mean we at St.  John's College---were convinced of such an argument,
And what to make of more recent lists of liberal arts, which are
equally definite, yet differ from the medieval one, both in kind and
in number?  There are two such lists, for example, on of the
St.  John's College website.  

Or again, as I have putting it, we need the very thing that is more likely lost than found on any such list, in being a list: namely, the *idea* of a liberal art.  

that only *lost* on such lists rather than found there.  Stick with the motif of "being lost" and talk of next issue as a deeper sense of being lost.  Mention how St.  John's website at first had nothing about the liberal arts.

[Move on to explain the deeper importance of this question: the ubiquitousness of lists indicates a certain, and potentially false, understanding of our freedom, and the relation of a liberal art to our freedom.] 

Later, use distinction between servile and liberal to indicate
importance of question, then introduce Meno as a deeper exploration of it.

economics, political theory, theology, biology, physics, music,

understand my lecture's title.  For it seems to be the very idea of a
liberal art that is lost [or one might say forgotton] when we identify
the liberal arts by name.

because of a interest in power.

"Lost" meaning forgotten, later meaning abandoned.

I'll come to the idea later, but I want to start by asking, why the
forgetfulness?
