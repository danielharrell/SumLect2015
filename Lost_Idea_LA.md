# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

## Introduction

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal
Art," is meant to express a worry I think one could have
about the future of liberal education. To have worries at
all, of course, has become reflexive among those of us in
any way devoted to this education. And there is no end these
days, it seems, to prophecies, even pronouncements, of
death. Type the words "death of liberal education" into
Google, and you get back such headlines as

All these headlines, I think, have one thing in common.
While they may disagree about the threat to liberal
education, they agree in distinguishing liberal education
from the threat, as if the threat were external. The
headlines make you think something *else* is killing liberal
education, whether it be liberals or conservatives or
technology or the economy. And it is hard to envision
a defense of liberal education without such a distinction,
even if headlines draw it simplistically, or even
inaccurately. For if liberal education itself were somehow
the threat, then death might well be liberal education's
best defense, but in defeat. No surprise, then, that those
of us devoted to liberal education are wont to conceive its
threats as if these came from outside it. For this justifies
a defense that succeeds only if liberal education survives.

And there is no shortage of such defenses. Type the words
"defense of liberal education" into Google, and you will
find one, it seems, for every headline predicting the death
of liberal education. And not just in articles. There are
books to defend liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There are blogs to defend liberal education, including [one
at St. John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/)
featuring regular posts by Christopher Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] There are campaigns to defend liberal
education, with slogans like *Securing America's Future: The
Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention just [one
initiative](http://www.cic.edu/Research-and-Data/Liberal-Arts/Campaign/Pages/default.aspx),
launched in 2012 by the Council of Independent
Colleges.[^campaigns] And behind these campaigns are
associations to defend liberal education, like the
just-mentioned [Council of Independent
Colleges](http://www.cic.edu/About-CIC/Pages/default.aspx),
or the [Association of American Colleges and
Universities](https://www.aacu.org/about), or the
[Association for General and Liberal
Studies](http://www.agls.org/AboutUs.htm), or the
[Association for Core Texts and
Courses](http://www.coretexts.org/), or the [American
Academy for Liberal
Education](http://www.aale.org/index.php/about-aale/mission).
There are so many defenders of liberal education, in fact,
that you can even find
[think-pieces](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/19/liberal-arts-colleges-rethink-their-messaging-face-criticism)
pondering why they seem to have failed, since liberal
education remains in peril.

But what if the defenders have succeeded---by putting
liberal education in peril? What if the threat to liberal
education comes from within? This is the worry I have in
mind. Let the idea of a liberal art, for the moment, simply
mean whatever it is that distinguishes a liberal education
from any other form of education---a technical education,
say. What if our many defenses of liberal education have
made us forget this idea? What if the idea of a liberal art
is lost?

The proposal of my lecture, then, will be that we have lost
this idea, and in a double sense. We have lost it, first, in
*an act* of forgetting; and second, in *a state* of
forgetting caused by the act. In the first sense of
forgetting, we would be in a condition of knowledge, more or
less, about what we have lost. And a case for this will be
made in the first part of my lecture. But in the second
sense of forgetting, we would be in a condition of
ignorance, and perhaps a fatal ignorance, about what we have
lost. And a case for this will be made in the second part of
my lecture. 

## Part One

In one respect, I think, the threat to liberal education
must always come from within. The fate of liberal education,
after all, will not be decided in headlines, but in
choices made by each of us about the best education, once
education matters. Not the best education, then, in general,
as such, *per se*; but the best education for my daughter,
or my son, or me. In having to make such choices, those
devoted to liberal education are no different from those
dismissive of it.  And in this respect, the threat to
liberal education can never lie outside it. To pursue an
education at all, liberal or no, is to have answered
a question that a liberal education obliges each of us to
ask, and ask on our own behalf: What does it mean to be
educated? And we might well answer this question in a choice
*against* liberal education, even at the risk of its
extinction, if the same choice is made repeatedly. But this
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the question is
real, and the threat to liberal education therefore
intrinsic to it. The death of liberal education, so
understood, would similarly come from within, in a proof of
its life, and perhaps the only proof of life.

But again, those of us devoted to liberal education are
unlikely to want this death, especially just to show we were
devoted to something rather than nothing. And while the
threat may be internal in this general sense, it is still
external, I think, in a more specific sense.
For if the threat to liberal education does come from
within, in a question it would have us ask for ourselves
about what it means to be educated, then while we may well
answer this question in a choice against liberal education,
we may also answer the question otherwise, by choosing
liberal education. Liberal education would then be a second
answer to the question, opposed to the first. And insofar as
one answer opposes the other, the threat to liberal
education would be external. 

But if the threat *is* external as one answer opposed to
another, then one thing, at least, can be inferred about any
defense of liberal education against this threat. It will
have to convince us that liberal education *does* provide an
answer, even for those who give a different answer. It will
have to show us that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, whatever might be gained; and that the
answer we give in such a choice, even if it turns out right,
risks being wrong. And showing this much, I think, means
showing there is something learned in liberal education,
which would otherwise go unlearned. To show, in short, that
liberal education has a subject-matter. Or, in a word:
content.

But what, then, *is* this content? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone? It is this question,
I think, that poses a challenge to liberal education from
within. For traditionally, the content of
a liberal education was identified with a curriculum of
seven liberal arts, a so-called *trivium* of grammar, logic,
and rhetoric; and a *quadrivium* of arithmetic, geometry,
music, and astronomy. Each of these arts was thought to
marry a skill to a subject. And together, these arts were
thought to form a whole. This is why one could say there was
*something* to learn in a liberal education, rather than
many things, or anything, or nothing. This is also what
one could say is contained in the idea of a liberal art:
a skill married to a subject, in a whole of such skills and
subjects, that gives content to a liberal education.

But one might also suspect that a liberal education has no
content in this sense, and that the liberal arts as
traditionally conceived show us why. They were learned,
after all, by the few rather than the many---the leisured
few, in that sense already free from servitude. The
education they received, then, was 'liberal,' it could be
argued, not in liberating them, but in shaping them,
stamping them, and perpetuating them. And the same might be
suspected of any content. For in what sense could we be
freed by it, rather than bound to it? What distinguishes
content, so-called, from dogma, or doctrine? What keeps it
from closing the mind that a truly liberal education is
meant to open? 

There are more specific reasons to wonder if a truly liberal
education has any content. And I will briefly discuss four
of them, which I think have compelled us to forget, more or
less deliberately, the idea of a liberal art. The first
reason, and perhaps the most pressing, comes from the
perceived threats to liberal education. For leaving
headlines aside, these can seem to reflect a triumph of
content over context, from college rankings and scorecards
at the start, to tests and grades at the end, making the
very meaning of education a matter of data-driven results,
and a choice against liberal education the answer to
a question never asked. Against all this, the first thing we
might think to say is that answers are not enough, results
are not enough, content is not enough. And this is one
element in defenses of liberal education. Here are
two examples: 

> The maturation of the student---not
information transfer---is the real purpose of colleges and
universities. Of course, information transfer occurs during
this process. One cannot become a master of one’s own
learning without learning something. But information
transfer is a corollary of the maturation process, not its
primary purpose.[^NelsonInfoTransfer]


> If we are to navigate skillfully the turbulent changes of
the twenty-first century, we must educate students not only
to process information effectively, but to think wisely and
well. To my mind, nothing fosters that end better than
a liberal arts education.[^Creighton]

[^NelsonInfoTransfer]:<http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/12/11/looking-value-college-wrong/>
[^Creighton]:<https://www.mtholyoke.edu/joannecreighton/article_liberal99>

The talk of turbulent changes in the second quote points to
a second reason we might wonder if a liberal education has
any content.  For suppose we did live in a world that
changes more than it abides, where our freedom, to the
extent this depended on skill, was a matter of adaptation
more than application. Any art that deserved the name
'liberal', in that case, would involve a skill more likely
divorced from any subject than married to one; which is to
say, a skill that can be applied to many subjects, even to
every subject, in a kind of liberation from content. And
suppose the number of such subjects to have multiplied past
counting, in one way the world indeed seems to have changed,
since the advent of modern science. If the liberal arts
could still be said to encompass a set of subjects, then it
would seem better understood as a diversity than as
a totality, in yet another liberation from content.  

And this is a second element in defenses of liberal
education: to separate its skills from its subjects. The
subjects, if they are specified at all, are specified to
give an impression of breadth, as if there were many things
one might learn in a liberal education rather than just one.
The current St. John's website, for example,
[speaks](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts)
of the college's "wide-ranging, interdisciplinary
curriculum," where "areas of study include philosophy,
literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and
languages." Other lists of subjects are even more expansive.
One from the earlier-mentioned *Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign [makes it
sound](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
as if you might study anything:  

> You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors
that are included in the liberal arts. They include much
more than studio art and English classes (though those are
great!)---they range from mathematics to Mandarin, from
statistics to sociology. At liberal arts colleges and
universities students can study the sciences---such as
biology, chemistry, and physics---and social
sciences---including economics, political science, and
psychology. Students can study newer subjects, such as
environmental science and neuroscience, and traditional
ones, too.

This same impression of breadth is given in the way defenses
of liberal education present its skills apart from subjects.
You can indeed learn anything, then, in learning *how* to
learn. And this encompasses a range of skills similarly
presented apart from subjects: how to read, how to write,
how to speak, even how to
think.[^ZakariaEarthly] St. John's way of putting this is
[to claim](<http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/>) that its
students "learn to speak articulately, read attentively,
reason effectively, and think creatively."

[^ZakariaEarthly]: For a typical example of this see
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fareed-zakaria/fareed-zakaria-liberal-arts-education_b_5380896.html>

And when the times are turbulent, to speak of skills apart
from subjects can seem to capture the essence of a truly
liberal art. Here is [one
example](http://www.sjc.edu/files/8013/9593/4530/league-of-women-voters-2011.pdf)
from an address by Chris Nelson: 

> With boundaries among the disciplines vanishing, with job
requirements and needs changing rapidly, we need citizens
prepared for change, prepared to adapt to jobs that do not
yet exist, prepared to enter an unknown world with a kind of
fearless determination to undertake whatever is required to
succeed. We will need skills of inquiry to enter a world we
cannot yet even envision.

In a more prosaic vein, defenses of liberal
education will call the liberal arts "transferable skills,"
[^transferable], again against the backdrop of an ever-changing
job market; just as "usefulness" has become
a ubiquitous word to counter the opinion, and the
traditional conviction, that the liberal arts are
useless.[^Linker] It is more generally the habit in
defenses of liberal education to talk of the liberal arts as
if they empowered us rather than enlightened us---the
aforementioned [*Power of Liberal Arts*
campaign](http://www.liberalartspower.org/Pages/default.aspx)
being the most explicit example.  

[^Linker]: "How can liberal education be saved? By becoming truly, enduringly
useful." <http://theweek.com/articles/559681/how-save-liberal-arts-education>

[^transferable]: "Although modern liberal arts curriculums have an updated
choice of a larger range of subjects, it still retains the
core aims of the liberal arts curricula maintained by the
medieval universities: to develop well-rounded individuals
with general knowledge of a wide range of subjects and with
mastery of a range of transferable skills. They will become
‘global citizens’, with the capacity to pursue lifelong
learning and become valuable members of their communities."
<http://www.topuniversities.com/blog/what-liberal-arts-education>

But to think of a liberal art as a skill without a subject
can make sense even if the world were never-changing. 
For the difference between learning
*how* to think and learning *what* to think, so we might
say, is precisely the difference between being educated and
being indoctrinated. We so come to a third reason, leaving
all utility aside, we might wonder if a liberal
education has any content. For suppose our given
condition---that is, our uneducated condition---were to
think we know when we don't. Or suppose we had answers, in
a sense, but to questions that have been forgotten. The end
of a liberal education would then seem to lie in
a recollection of questions; or a knowledge of ignorance.
Which is to say, in something less like the learning of
content, and more again like the liberation from content.

And this is a third element in defenses of liberal
education: to identify learning with the act of questioning
rather than the act of answering. This is especially so at
St. John's, where it would sound antiquated to claim, as
Scott Buchanan did in the first catalog of the New Program,
on behalf of a traditional conception of liberal arts, that
these were "the arts of apprehending, understanding, and
knowing the truth."[^Buchanan] What we say instead is self-consciously
Socratic; I give two recent examples of this,
one from a blogpost of Chris Nelson; the other from an address given
by a recent St. John's graduate:

> Liberal education is the best and quickest way to become
comfortable not knowing. By mastering a range of subject
matter that may not always be congenial, students are
repeatedly brought to the point of intellectual impasse. In
time, they become comfortable with their ignorance.[^Nelson_comfort]

> Before I came to the College, I read enthusiastically, yet
timidly. Now I read with fiercely inquisitive bravery.
I have learned that great questions lead to more and more
questions, not necessarily to answers, and I have learned
that the greatness of the human spirit shows itself in just
this realization. As Socrates says in Plato’s *Meno*: “We
shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think
that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we
indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no
use in seeking to know what we do not know.” We must have
intellectual bravery, that is, the courage to push forward,
to continue seeking truth even in the face of doubts about
its very existence.[^Tyson]

[^Buchanan]: "The arts of apprehending, understanding, and knowing the
truth are the liberal arts, and they set their own ends."
(*Bulletin of St. John's College in Annapolis, 1937--38*).

[^Nelson_comfort]: <http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/10/20/knowing-learn/>

A final example in this vein comes from the announcement for
a conference on liberal education, held on the Santa Fe campus
last year, where Socratic inquiry is put at the center of what
we do, and the liberal arts mentioned only in passing.

> At St. John’s College, it has continued to be our
> conviction that the root questions of life can be taken up
> by any serious person. We have made the Socratic
> approach---of open, courageous, and philosophically minded
> inquiry---central to the work of every class. We welcome
> friends (and critics) and educators from near and far to
> join us for this conference, which we envision as a broad
> platform to speak about the challenges and opportunities
> for liberal education today, and to engage in exemplary
> studies in the liberal arts (interpretive and substantive
> work on texts and within disciplines).[^SFConf]

[^SFConf]: <http://www.sjc.edu/programs-and-events/santa-fe/50th-anniversary-conference/>

It is this same Socratic approach that explains why an
all-required program of books, which might otherwise be
thought full of content, can more deeply be said to lack it.
For anything written down, we could claim, is simply
doctrine, until a reader puts it into dialogue by
questioning it rather than assimilating it. This brings us
to a final reason we might wonder if a liberal education has
any content; and perhaps our best reason to forget the idea
of a liberal art. For suppose we were only able to learn,
truly learn, insofar as we did this for ourselves, from
within. What we learned, in that case, would seem to be
found in the self, or even the soul, rather than in a set of
subjects. And this is the same self that a liberal
education makes free. So the more liberal an education becomes, we
might say, the more that *what* we learn is a matter of
*how* we learn, and *who* we become in learning it. Which at
one college, at least, is to say the more that any so-called
subject is found in a book, which is found in a reader of
that book, who is found in a conversation about that book,
which brings the book to life, with all it may contain. And
this conversation, both with others and with oneself, would
embody a liberal education without content: an education in
selfhood rather than subjects, where the something we
finally learn is what it means to learn, and even what it
means to love it.   

The suspicion that a truly liberal education has no content,
then, can be cast in terms that encompass what many of us,
I think, might say a liberal education finally is, and where
any appeal to a number of liberal arts seems beside the
point. It is no surprise, then, that the self, and a self
ready for anything, is a final element in defenses of
liberal education, as a way of characterizing its end. Here
is one example from the same address by a recent St. John's graduate
that I quoted just above: 

> After my two-year commitment with Teach For America,
I hope to continue my work in the field of education. But
really, I can do anything. St. John’s has given me the
tools: the ability to listen, to think, to speak, to write,
and ultimately, to act. I need only to decide where to
direct my passion, and the world is mine, thanks to the
incredible education I have had the blessing to receive
here. [^Tyson]

[^Tyson]: <http://www.thejohnniechair.com/when-you-know-better-you-do-better-a-seniors-reflections-on-st-johns/> and parts quoted in <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-nelson/is-it-worth-it_1_b_3321206.html>

I can mention one more example in this vein, as a way to
conclude Part One of my lecture. For in wanting to capture
this kind of student voice on behalf of its education, St.
John's performed an experiment for several months, when it
first launched its new website. And the experiment was to
describe itself without any mention about the liberal arts,
or even liberal education, in the fully deliberate attempt,
so one might say, to forget the whole idea. 


## Part Two

Here is what another graduate of St. John's had to say about
this experiment, in one of the few recent defenses of liberal
education, so far as I know, that claims any content
for it: 

> Even my own alma mater, St. John’s College, a liberal arts
college par excellence, has recently dropped both “liberal
arts” and “liberal education” from its own
self-description---which is a bit like the canary you brought
down into the coal mine drawing out a little pistol and
shooting itself in the head. St. John’s now speaks about an
education that develops “critical thinking and
collaboration”---good things, to be sure, but skills one can
learn behind that notorious Starbucks counter, where you’re
at least getting paid. Or, for that matter, in kindergarten.[^McClay]

[^McClay]: <http://spectator.org/articles/60752/defense-liberal-arts>

The canary, I think, is a good image of the forgetfulness
that one might worry has been induced by the way, as
I described above, we have knowingly forgotten the idea of
a liberal art. Once the idea of a liberal art in that sense
is lost, so the worry might be put, perhaps those who lost
it are lost, in thinking they are still devoted to
something, when there is nothing left to be devoted to. We
could also frame this worry in the terms I used in Part One
to account for any successful defense. For if
a defense of liberal education deprives it, in effect, of
any content, then how can the defense convince us that
liberal education provides an answer to the question of
what it means to be educated, even for those who give a different
answer? How can it show us that
something is lost in a choice against liberal education,
whatever might be gained? Or that the answer we give in such
a choice, even if it turns out right, risks being wrong? 

The worry, then, is that it can't. And the reference to
kindergarten in the passage above gives us a first
indication of why. On the one hand, it is hard to deny that
learning how to learn, along with how to read, write, speak,
and think, are useful skills; and one might even grant their
necessity for a life lived in freedom. On the other hand, it
is also hard to see how they belong to a liberal education
rather than to any education, until it is said just what is
learned, or read, or written, or spoken, or thought, to
locate these skills in a liberal education alone. But to say
this is just what defenses of liberal education refuse to say, in
wanting to claim that the skills in question can be applied
to anything. And the more indispensable the skills imparted
by a liberal education sound, the harder it is to conceive
them as liberal rather than remedial or rudimentary: the
kind of skills that one indeed begins to learn in
kindergarten. 

There are, of course, ways to specify such skills, but they
reflect another aspect of the problem. To recall St. John's
way of doing this, in a liberal education you learn how to
speak articulately, or how to read attentively, or how to reason
effectively, or how to think creatively. But should we then
believe that you will be left speaking inarticulately,
reading inattentively, reasoning ineffectively, or thinking
uncreatively, if you choose another kind of education---say,
to pursue a degree in computer programming? The implication
is not just incredible, but insulting; and it risks the very
elitism that prompted us, on my account above, to forget the
traditional idea of a liberal art. But perhaps nothing is
meant against another form of education when it is said what
you can learn in a liberal education. But if so, then what
again distinguishes a liberal education from any education? 

The same problem emerges if we try to distinguish a liberal
education, with no appeal to content, on higher-sounding
grounds. In [one of his
blogposts](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/03/11/five-reasons-to-attend-st-johns-college/?_ga=1.184745897.1475954775.1399757768),
for example, Chris Nelson writes: "St. John’s College is the
right fit for someone who is seeking a special sort of
education---an education in the arts of freedom, an
education in how to make learning and life their own." But
in what sense, exactly, does this distinguish a St.
John's education from any education, or even from human
experience as such? For one could say that this is indeed
experience, rather than innocence, or
mere endurance, precisely through the kind of
learning, and living, that is necessarily one's own. Or
suppose we follow the St. John's graduate I quoted in the
first part of my lecture, and claim that St. John's will
teach you intellectual courage: how to persevere in the
pursuit of knowledge rather than yield in the face of
ignorance. Perhaps St. John's will, but so will any field of
research one might pursue, it could be argued, that relies
on science rather than superstition to reach its results.
And making references back to Socrates, as if the
Enlightenment never happened, won't be enough to distinguish
St. John's in particular, or liberal education more
generally, on the matter of intellectual courage. 

We come, then, to the first thing forgotten in a defense of
liberal education that dispenses with the idea of a liberal
art by depriving this education, in effect, of any content.
The first thing forgotten is how to distinguish a liberal
education from any education, or even from what happens in
human life regardless of education. Or again, how to provide
an answer to the question of what it means to be educated,
even for those who give a different answer. But this leads
to something else that seems forgotten: how to convince
those who give a different answer, that this is not the only
answer, at least for those who become serious about their
education, and want it to have content. For example,
*Bloomberg Businessweek* recently published [a 38,000 word
essay](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
entitled "What is Code?." And if you read this essay, it is
hard to shake the impression that it makes more sense of
a liberal education than anything published in its defense.
This is not just because the writer of the essay knows how
to write, and proves it over the course of 38,000 words. It
is also because of what he is writing about, which starts to
sound like a true liberal art by the time he is through:
a skill, programming, wedded to a subject, code, that
encompasses a kind of whole in contemporary life. ---And
indeed the kind of whole in contemporary life---the essay
again appeared in *Businessweek*---that defenses of liberal
education will claim it best prepares its graduates for.
A serious high school student who read this essay might be
forgiven, then, if she concluded that a real college
education could be had by pursuing a programming degree, and
that making learning one's own means learning one thing
well. 

But this is just one example, and hypothetical at that, of
a more general, actual, and recognized problem. Defenders of
liberal education can speak with eloquence against the
penchant in education for testing and ranking and training
and specializing. They again can say that content is not
enough, against the seeming triumph of content over context.
But this risks the impression that a liberal education, in
supposedly transcending all this, is really an education for
dilettantes, providing an escape from being challenged or
judged or driven or dedicated. And what can be said to
counter this impression, if in a liberal education, these
virtues are matters of context rather than content? Which is
to say, matters about which nothing more can be said, but
only shown---where you see such students for yourself? Or
even be such a student yourself?---as one noted defender of
liberal education, Andrew Delbanco, [puts
it](http://chronicle.com/article/College-at-Risk/130893/),
when he writes:

> One of the difficulties in making the case
for liberal education against the rising tide of skepticism
is that it is almost impossible to persuade doubters who
have not experienced it for themselves. The Puritan founders
of our oldest colleges would have called it "such a mystery
as none can read but they that know it."

This way of putting the problem captures what is
potentially self-defeating, and even self-negating, in
defenses of liberal education that deprive it of content.
For if the point of any defense is *to persuade* people to
experience liberal education for themselves, then how can
there be a defense that depends on such an experience to be
persuasive?  

This question points us to a third thing forgotten in
defenses of liberal education that deprive it of content.
For while speaking against content makes a kind of sense,
against the triumph of content over context; it risks
defining the defense as a defense of context over content;
that is, a defense of what truly binds us by way of context,
over what we merely suspect may bind us by way of content.
And indeed the essential gesture in defenses of liberal
education, once content is given up, might be described as
contextualizing, where the place of liberal education is
located firmly in the world rather than at all apart from
it. The mantra of "usefulness" in defenses is perhaps the
most important sign of this contextualizing, but even more
visible are the images you can find in liberal arts college
brochures and websites, which, being images rather than
text, increasingly try to capture the experience of
a liberal education, when explanations of it not enough. St.
John's has its own striking history of this; for not so long
ago it packaged its education in a brown paper wrapper; as
if the education not only had content, but the kind of
content that couldn't be seen from outside. Even the first
video it made of itself was scripted and staged, retaining
at least that much separation from the ongoing world. But it
is precisely this separation that is now thought better
erased than preserved, and communication efforts seem aimed
at giving the impression that what separates the college
from the outside world is merely a window.

What seems to have been forgotten here is the original point
of setting a liberal education part. Education was once regarded
as a serious enough thing, but also fragile enough thing, to
be set apart from the ongoing world rather than anchored there. And the
freedom involved was at the end of the education, in a mode
of self-transformation rather than self-affirmation. (use above):
We have replaced this package, ign is found
in the images The defense of liberal education on the
grounds of its usefulness rather than uselessness, as if in
a freedom for the world.  is perhaps and its ends are
anchored in the world. one of anchoring liberal education in
the world, against the traditional notion that it stood
apart from the world, and even aloof from the world and even
aloof. 

And if we can be
suspicious of content insofar as it binds us rather than
frees us, then it seems we can even more suspicious of
context, which arguably binds us by its very nature. And I think
it is on this very point that we can begin to find something
deeply misconceived in 

sk how
we are freed by content rather than bound to it, he same
suspicion that we might be bound to content rather than
freed by it, might be directed all the more to matters of
context, which are essentially bounded. it also defines such
defenses in a counter-triumph of context over content. against any impression that it stands apart from the
world.  or even aloof  attempt to anchor liberal education
makes sense to call defenses of liberal education then one
might characterize the defense as a triumph of context over
content, one way of characterizing these defenses, in light
of the second problem with context, is to make context
triumph over content. Which is to say: to present a liberal
education, increasingly, as if it were possible to
experience it for oneself. Or to put this still another way,
to root it in the world rather than separate it from the
world. , 

alike this: 
And if these
are matters of context rather than content, then the
impression of dilettantism can only be corrected, in effect,
by an invitation to campus. And what if the invitation is
declined?  But we
can recognize that this rejoinder, too, is not enough, and
even see that saying what more is needed, if this is
context, escapes being specified, in just the way it escapes
being captured in a data-driven result. Yet this can reduce
our defense of liberal education to something like
inarticulate pointing. And what if no one else turns around?
Or to put the problem with context more concretely, we can
speak with eloquence 

Described this as a liberation from content, but it can look more
like a flight from content.

Only so much that can be said about a liberal education; the
essence of it can only be shown. You have to see it for yourself.
Contextualization is like specification.


(Put after discussion of context.) More generally it seems as
if this entire line of defense risks falling apart as soon
as you take it seriously and not just rhetorically. 

Or perhaps this is not the implication (use this idea to transition
into how not having content risks not giving a real answer, but a fake one.)

The ever-changing world like an unexamined opinion.

Note: to be non-elistist is to include the slave-boy, not Meno.

In an ever-changing world, now more than ever, a liberal
arts education is needed, with its truly useful skills.

The more seriously you take its claims, the more empty they
seem.
