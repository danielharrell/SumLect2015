# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art," is
best introduced, perhaps, if we consider a recent attempt to answer
the question: "What Are The Liberal Arts?" Here is how the answer
starts:

> A liberal arts education means studying broadly---taking classes in
  many different subjects---and building skills that are geared toward
  more than just one profession. By studying the liberal arts,
  students develop strong critical thinking, problem solving, and
  communication skills. Liberal arts students learn to approach
  questions flexibly and to think across multiple disciplines. These
  are skills employers say they value most, even more than a specific
  major. **In today’s labor market, career paths are changing rapidly,
  and graduates must draw from a variety of skillsets to adapt to
  challenges and capitalize on opportunities.**

Already we might notice something getting lost in this answer. [Later
use "forgotten" for this] True, it speaks at comparative length of
what can be gained by a study of liberal arts. But it says almost
nothing about what they are. The answer so far, it seems, is simply
"many different subjects."

But as I said, this is only the start of the answer. The answer
continues like this:

>You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors that are
 included in the liberal arts. They include much more than studio art
 and English classes (though those are great!)---they range from
 mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology. At liberal
 arts colleges and universities students can study the sciences---such
 as biology, chemistry, and physics---and social sciences—including
 economics, political science, and psychology. Students can study
 newer subjects, such as environmental science and neuroscience, and
 traditional ones, too.

The answer "many different subjects" is elaborated here. But only, it seems, by way of expansion, to encompass almost any subject you could think of, or want to study. We might wonder what *isn't* a liberal art on this account. For we have gotten no answer to the question of what *is* one, which tells us what a liberal art finally *is*, no matter how many there might be. Or to borrow a figure from Plato's *Meno*, we've been given a *swarm* of liberal arts, when we might have wanted just one liberal art, so to speak, that makes any member of the swarm, indeed, a member. What we would want, in that case, might be called the *idea* of a liberal art. And it would be this idea, then, that has gotten lost in the answer above.  We ask what the liberal arts are, and are given too many in reply to know. 

But how many are too many? For it can seem as if the idea of a liberal
art will be lost in any list. The most distinguished such list is
surely the medieval one, which divides the liberal arts into one group
of three, the *trivium*, inclusive of grammar, logic, and rhetoric;
and another group of four, the *quadrivium*, inclusive of arithmetic
and geometry, music and astronomy. But what makes these the liberal
arts? [perhaps get rid of this next sentence.] And in what sense do
they form a comprehensive list, rather than merely a partial list, or,
at best, a representative list?

We can press such questions by considering a [more recent list](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/) found on the website of a college known to us all. "The liberal arts," so it begins, "are at the heart of St. John’s College." We follow this with not one but two lists of liberal arts. The first includes philosophy, literature, history, mathematics, economics, political theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and languages.  The second list reduces this first list to literature, philosophy and theology, history and social sciences, mathematics and natural sciences, and music. 




> Areas of study include philosophy, literature, history, mathematics, economics, political theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and languages, offering a truly comprehensive liberal arts education as illustrated in the chart below.
Start with St. John's List, pointing out distinction between books and divisions, comprehensive vs book's beginning, middle, and end.] 
 [Move on to examples of trivium and quadrivium, then to St. John's current list] Final sentenc should be the one below]
This, then, is one way to understand my lecture's title. For it seems to be the very idea of a liberal art that is lost [or one might say forgotton] when we identify the liberal arts by name.

Mention how very act of specification of liberal arts runs this risk, because of a interest in power.

[Perhaps introduce third paragraph and power here. Start with Meno and move back to example.] Explaining why it's easy to forget. Mention recommendation from Siegelvision] How we struck liberal arts from website.

"Lost" meaning forgotten, later meaning abandoned. 

I'll come to the idea later, but I want to start by asking, why the forgetfulness?
