# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art," is best introduced, perhaps, if we consider a recent attempt to answer the question: "What Are The Liberal Arts?" Here is how the answer starts:

> A liberal arts education means studying broadly---taking classes in many different subjects---and building skills that are geared toward more than just one profession. By studying the liberal arts, students develop strong critical thinking, problem solving, and communication skills. Liberal arts students learn to approach questions flexibly and to think across multiple disciplines. These are skills employers say they value most, even more than a specific major. In today’s labor market, career paths are changing rapidly, and graduates must draw from a variety of skillsets to adapt to challenges and capitalize on opportunities.

Already we might notice something getting lost in this answer. For while it speaks at comparative length of what can be gained by a study of liberal arts, it says almost nothing about the nature of those arts. What they are, it seems, is simply "many different subjects."

But as I said, this is only the start of the answer. The answer continues like this: 

>You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors that are included in the liberal arts. They include much more than studio art and English classes (though those are great!)---they range from mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology. At liberal arts colleges and universities students can study the sciences---such as biology, chemistry, and physics---and social sciences—including economics, political science, and psychology. Students can study newer subjects, such as environmental science and neuroscience, and traditional ones, too.
