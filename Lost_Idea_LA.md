# The Lost Idea of a Liberal Art

## Introduction

The title of my lecture tonight, "The Lost Idea of a Liberal
Art," is meant to express a worry I have about the future of
liberal education. To have worries at all, of course, has
become reflexive among those of us in any way devoted to
this education, whether we be students of it, teachers of
it, or in some other form stewards of it. And there is no
end these days, it seems, to prophecies, even
pronouncements, of death. Type the words "death of liberal
education" into Google, and you get back such headlines as

All these headlines, I think, have one thing in common.
While they may disagree about the threat to liberal
education, they agree in distinguishing liberal education
from the threat, as if the threat were external. The
headlines make you think something *else* is killing liberal
education, whether it be liberals or conservatives or
technology or the economy. And it is hard to envision
a defense of liberal education without such a distinction,
even if headlines draw it simplistically, or even
inaccurately. For if liberal education itself were somehow
the threat, then death might well be liberal education's
best defense, but in defeat. No surprise, then, that those
of us devoted to liberal education are wont to conceive its
threats as if these came from outside it. For this justifies
a defense that succeeds only if liberal education survives.

And there is no shortage of such defenses. Type the words
"defense of liberal education" into Google, and you will
find one, it seems, for every headline predicting the death
of liberal education. And not just in articles. There are
books to defend liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There are blogs to defend liberal education, including [one
at St. John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/)
featuring regular posts by Christopher Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] There are campaigns to defend liberal
education, with slogans like *Securing America's Future: The
Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention just [one
initiative](http://www.cic.edu/Research-and-Data/Liberal-Arts/Campaign/Pages/default.aspx),
launched in 2012 by the Council of Independent
Colleges.[^campaigns] And behind these campaigns are
associations to defend liberal education, like the
just-mentioned [Council of Independent
Colleges](http://www.cic.edu/About-CIC/Pages/default.aspx),
or the [Association of American Colleges and
Universities](https://www.aacu.org/about), or the
[Association for General and Liberal
Studies](http://www.agls.org/AboutUs.htm), or the
[Association for Core Texts and
Courses](http://www.coretexts.org/), or the [American
Academy for Liberal
Education](http://www.aale.org/index.php/about-aale/mission).
There are so many defenders of liberal education, in fact,
that you can even find
[think-pieces](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/19/liberal-arts-colleges-rethink-their-messaging-face-criticism)
pondering why they seem to have failed, since liberal
education remains in peril.

But what if these defenders have succeeded---in 
putting liberal education in peril? What if the threat to
liberal education comes from within? This is my worry. Let
the idea of a liberal art, for the moment, simply mean
whatever it is that distinguishes a liberal education from
any other form of education---a technical education, say.
What if our many defenses of liberal education have made us
forget this idea? What if the idea of a liberal art is lost?

In my lecture, then, I want to explain why I worry we have
lost this idea, and what it is, more exactly, we may have
lost. 

## Part One

Now in one sense, I think, the threat to liberal education
must always come from within. The fate of liberal education,
after all, will not be decided in headlines, but in
choices made by each of us about the best education, once
education matters. Not the best education, then, in general,
as such, *per se*; but the best education for my daughter,
or my son, or me. In having to make such choices, those
devoted to liberal education are no different from those
dismissive of it.  And in this respect, the threat to
liberal education can never lie outside it. To pursue an
education at all, liberal or no, is to have answered
a question that a liberal education obliges each of us to
ask, and ask on our own behalf: What does it mean to be
educated? And we might well answer this question in a choice
*against* liberal education, even at the risk of its
extinction, if the same choice is made repeatedly. But this
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the question is
real, and the threat to liberal education therefore
intrinsic to it. The death of liberal education, so
understood, would similarly come from within, in a proof of
its life, and perhaps the only proof of life.

But again, those of us devoted to liberal education are
unlikely to want this death, especially just to show we were
devoted to something rather than nothing. And while the
threat may be internal in this general sense, it is still
external, I think, in a more specific sense.
For if the threat to liberal education does come from
within, in a question it would have us ask for ourselves
about what it means to be educated, then while we may well
answer this question in a choice against liberal education,
we may also answer the question otherwise, by choosing
liberal education. Liberal education would then be a second
answer to the question, opposed to the first. And insofar as
one answer opposes the other, the threat to liberal
education would be external. 

But if the threat *is* external as one answer opposed to
another, then at least one thing can be inferred about any
defense of liberal education against this threat. It will
have to convince us that liberal education *does* provide an
answer, even for those who give a different answer. It will
have to show us that something is lost in a choice against
liberal education, whatever might be gained; and that the
answer we give in such a choice, even if it turns out right,
risks being wrong. And showing this much, I think, means
showing there is something learned in liberal education,
which would otherwise go unlearned. To show, in short, that
liberal education has a subject-matter. Or, in a word:
content.


But if so, then what *is* this content? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone? 

## Part Two

It is this question, I think, that poses a challenge to
liberal education from within. And this challenge leads to
the threat that worries me, with a kind of logic that I will
now try to trace. Traditionally, the content of a liberal
education was identified with a curriculum of seven liberal
arts, a so-called *trivium* of grammar, logic, and rhetoric;
and a *quadrivium* of arithmetic, geometry, music, and
astronomy. Each of these arts was thought to marry a skill
and a subject. And together, these arts were thought to form
a whole. This is why one could say there was *something* to
learn in a liberal education, rather than many things, or
anything, or nothing. 

But one might also say, or at least suspect, that this
medieval curriculum was a form of initiation and
indoctrination, with a history of exclusion and oppression.
For the liberal arts were traditionally learned by the few
rather than the many---the leisured few, in that sense
already free from servitude. The education they received,
then, was 'liberal,' it could be argued, not in liberating
them, but in shaping them, stamping them, and perpetuating
them. And the same might be suspected of any content. For in
what sense could we be freed by it, rather than bound to it?
What distinguishes content, so-called, from dogma, or
doctrine? What keeps it from closing the mind that a truly
liberal education is meant to open? These questions point to
a paradox in the very notion of a liberal education. For if
this is to be an education, then there must be something to
learn, which in that sense determines us. But this something
must also free us, if the education is to be liberal. How,
then, is the paradox to be resolved? What should we say is
learned in a liberal education alone that at once determines us
yet frees us? 

(Organization of following part: make point about liberating us
from content: first in liberal arts (with examples) then with ignorance
(Pamela Kraus example), and finally with learning.
(Shift from liberation from content to flight from content.)


Suppose our given
condition were to think we know when we don't. Or to have
answers, but to questions that have been forgotten. The end
of a liberal education would then seem to lie in the
recollection of questions, or a knowledge of ignorance. Both
to say, in something less like the learning of content, and
more like the liberation from content. 

Or to look at our given condition from another angle,
suppose we lived in a world that changes more than it
abides, and our freedom, then, a matter of adaptation more
than application. Any art that deserved the name 'liberal',
in that case, would involve a skill more likely divorced
from any subject than married to one; which is to say,
a skill that can be applied to many subjects, even to every
subject, in yet another liberation from content. And suppose
the number of such subjects to have multiplied past counting
since medieval times, in one of the most striking ways the
world has changed, with the advent of modern science. This
would seem to leave the number of liberal arts
indefinite, and better understood to encompass a variety or
diversity than to form some totality or whole, in still
another liberation from content.     

Or to look at our given condition from yet a final angle:
suppose we could only learn, truly learn, insofar as we did
this for ourselves. What we learned, in that case, would
seem to be found in the self, or even the soul, rather than
in a set of subjects. Here we would have a final liberation
from content, that still possessed a unity in the self. And
pressing the point, we might say that the more liberal an
education becomes, the more that what we learn is a matter
of how we learn, and who we are in learning it, along with
who we become. Or, to put this in terms closer to home, we
could say that the more liberal an education becomes, the
more that any so-called subject is found in a book, which is
found in a reader of that book, who is found in
a conversation about that book, that brings the book to
life, with all it may contain. And this conversation,
conducted by turns with others and with oneself, would thereby
embody a liberal education without content, which is to say:
an education in selfhood rather than subjects, where the
something we finally learn is what it means to learn, and
even what it means to love it.  

(Need to include sentence about how the unity then is shifted
from content to selfhood.)

The suspicion that a truly liberal education has no content,
then, can be cast in terms that encompass what many of us,
I think, might say a liberal education is. And it is close enough
to what
we do say it is. To give just one example of this,
here are the words of recent St. John's graduate, speaking of  in an address
delivered to and indeed what
we do say it is. (Mention student quote.) Liberal education
faces its own challenge: for someone liberally educated to
sound like that student, than like a dry and dusty latin
scholar, or, to borrow a different image, than like the
Mississippi slave-holder who knows his Greek. (In this
paragraph, make clearer the distinction between skills and
soul. Highlight this in student speech, and distinguish it
from the dry and dusty latin scholar on the one hand, or the
Mississippi slave-holder who knows his Greek.) (This part
should be cast explictly in terms of internal challenge,
before we ever face external challenge, which seems to
encourage more denial of content.) Also, when moving to
defense, note that these were parts of speech that
Christopher Nelson decided to quote. Also: frame defense in
terms of providing a context in light of a human life well
lived.  Engagement with life.


And this includes
what we might say to defend it, in light of what we see to
threaten it. For leaving headlines aside, the list of such
threats can seem to reflect the triumph of content over
context, from college rankings and scorecards at the start
to tests and grades at the end, reducing the very meaning of
education to a matter of data-driven results, and making any
choice against liberal education seem the answer to
a question never asked. Against all this, the first thing we
might think to say that answers are not enough, results are
not enough, or finally that content is not enough. 

But we can recognize that this rejoinder, too, is not
enough, and even see that saying what more is needed, if
this is context, escapes being specified, in just the
way it escapes being captured in a data-driven result. Yet 
this can reduce our defense of liberal education to
something like inarticulate pointing. And what if no one
else turns around? Or to put the problem with context more
concretely, we can speak with eloquence against the penchant
in education for testing and ranking and training and
specializing. But this risks the impression that
a liberal education, in supposedly transcending all this, is
really an education for dilettantes, providing an escape
from being challenged or judged or driven or dedicated. Yet
if these are matters of context rather than content, then
the impression of dilettantism can only be corrected, in
effect, by an invitation to campus. And what if the
invitation is declined?  

This is the first sign that a defense based on denial of content is
lacking, and even poses an internal threat.  
or if this is context for the Also rhetorical.
content,  , if this is context for the content, can only be
invoked rather than specified, lest it be turned into
content. at the risk of being turned into content. not only
escapes data-driven results, but and therefore something
that and not be found in data-driven results, can only be
specified at the risk of being made invoked rather than
described. hard to put in words. s a matter of context
rather than content, hat more is needed if these are not
enough, and if content needs to give way to context, how to
formulate that in a general way. Also, we give over to , and
even that to defend liberal education And this sharpens
reduces our rejoinder of liberal education to a refrain that
answers are not enough, results are not enough, content is
not enough---even if this defense of liberal education is
not enough. Information over insight.  

(Perhaps use answers is not enough refrain at start, at what
one feels like saying, even if it is recognized this is not
enough in defense, because of context. But then raise
a question, if the rest is context, what can be said.) But
this also seems to reduce the rejoinder of liberal education
to a refrain that answers are not enough, results are not
enough, content is not enough, since the rest is a matter of
context. But this can seem suicide, if you think that the
end of activity is indeed a matter of answers, results, or
content. the more that is needed is a matter of context
. since there is no way, in rejoinder, to privilgive content
to context, And this can seem to reduce liberal education's
response to the refrain of answers are not enough, results
are not enough, content is not enough, in a defense of
liberal education that is almost certainly not enough.
Answers are not enough; results are not enough; content is
not enough. Defending a liberal education can then reduce to
finding a place for liberal education, o find a place for
liberal education nd to stand against answers in this sense,
or results in this sense, or mere content more generally,
this reduces the defense of liberal education to a criticism
of content, so understood. For those who don't like
challenge, or focus, or single-mindedness, or ranks.
. o speak in defense of liberal education being tested, or
being graded, o speak in defense of liberal education,
accordingly, is to speak agaispeak on behalf of context,
; but since there is no way to give context content  to put
context in a general formulation,

It becomes hard to speak on behalf of liberal education
without speaking against content. And this accordingly
reduces a defense of liberal education to an attack on
content, so understood, whether it would accordingly be
against content in this sense that a defense of liberal
education must be made. 

To see this threat in grades, for example,
or tests, or other forms of results-driven assessment, is to
defend the substance of liberal education as if it cannot be
graded or tested or otherwise assessed as a result. And to
see this threat in STEM, is to defend the process of liberal
education as if it lacked focus, penetration, or
single-mindedness.  how learning happens in liberal
education as if it lacked the focus, and penetration action
as i it We deprive it of content in some sense, for example,
when talking of how it transcends the giving of grades, or
taking of tests, or any other mode of results-driven
assessment. Or when we talk of how it talking of how it can
help develop the breadth of mind needed to flourish in
a technological world, always on the move. when liberate it
from any contentWhen talking, for example, of developing the
how to react think flexibly and critically in
a technological world, always on the move. e might for
example say that a liberal education is an education that
transcends the giving of grades, or tests, or any other mode
of results-driven assessment. Or we might say that a liberal
education, against , or in essence. it ultimately is.
adefense. it can even seem the basis of a defense: in
a lower register, involving skills, or the denouncing of
tests, in a higher register, that. But this is why, I think,
the suspicion should be treated as a perennial threat to
liberal education rather than a potential defense. (talk
about the lost idea of a liberal art here).

(from here, talk of how it
can be expanded, dressed up, associated with things we want
to say about liberal education ultimately, in its greatest
importance, and are prevalent, as we shall later see, can be
deeply resonante to an audience like St. John's. But to my
mind, this makes its being wrong all the more profound and
worrisome. Or just: deeply wrong.). 

And this would
not preclude liberal education, so understood, from
providing an answer to the question of what it means to be
educated. For the answer in that case would be nothing but
the question, which a liberal education would oblige us to
ask explicitly, and seriously, and which risks being
answered, by a choice against liberal education, without
being asked.  


There seems something plausible, then, in the notion that
a liberal education has no content---as plausible as the
notion that a liberally educated person is open rather than
closed. Worth dwelling on this. (Perhaps make into open-minded vs closed-minded.)an
education without content, then, seems as easy as thinking
of someone educated as open rather than closed. And it can
become all the more plausible to those of us who have read
our Plato and encountered his Socrates, a Socrates "made
beautiful and young", as Plato admits. But also worth dwelling
on the counterargument. then again, it is
to Socrates that we owe perhaps our earliest account of
a liberal education, in Plato's *Republic*. one a moment or
two of further reflection, I think, will show what is
implausible and finally unintelligible about it. 

Don't forget arrogance of dismissing other forms of education
as unthinking.
second look, I think,
reveals something unintelligible in it, shows why it must be nonsense. unintelligible. it is also
wrong, profoundly wrong, I think, mistaken, utterly wrong, at least if we I think, at least if this conception we
renounce he conception is understood to take it if we take
it readers of Plato who have fallen, so to speak, for his
depiction of Socrates as the one man in Athens who knows he
doesn't know. Here, bring up Socrates proposing liberal
arts, and using them in Meno. Start with Meno and content.
Perplexity before a question that has no answer, but this
ends up meaning the presence of content (Socrates has to
draw the line) rather than the absence of content. Then move
on to how this is also inclusive of the slave-boy in an
experience of learning.) For there to be no content is
actually more indicative of Meno, and his interest in power.
Note that Socrates question to slave boy has no answer,
strictly speaking, but it requires mathematics to make sense
of this, and there is no way to avoid the diagonal as an
object of content, even an object that Socrates has to
supply. Then move on to questions of inclusiveness, an
experience of learning that includes the slave boy.

Answer isn't to have no one read, but but to have everyone read.

St. John's order: rejection of liberal arts, then brought back, but first hit
of search gets to conference page, where questions are made central. More
generally, even if books are central, conversation about books more central. Classes
resemble philosophy graduate seminars, or book clubs. 
even make my earlier claim paradoxical: that the only sense
in which liberal education provides an answer to the question of what it means
to be educated, is in being an education in questions rather than answers. claim that a liberal education is an education
in questions rather than answers, casting doubt on my earlier claim
that liberal education provides an answer .  doubt that a liberal education, if
indeed liberal, is an education ould ever provide an answer to any
question, much less one about what it means to be educated.
For answering a question puts it to rest; ; wers to questions,
the meaning of education; indeed liberal,  could ever
provide an answer to any question, much less a question
about the meaning of education, against content, we can
evenwonder about my earlier claim that the survival of
liberal education depends on providing an answer to the
question what it means to be education. For isn't a liberal
education, first and last, a place of answers. is not only
to provoke a question about the meaning of education, but
provide an answer. For isn't provides an answer to the
question (Try to mention the act of questioning again,
alluding back to earlier point, .) Why there is indeed
something to learn in a liberal education, then how If we
are to be possessors of our education and not simply
products of it, 

And ifif there were
something to learn in a liberal education, , for in what sense is the content
of an education distinguishable from for in what sense could we be truly
liberated by it rather than merely determined by it? 
. , exactly, does the content of an education liberate us,
rather than merely determine us. could we be liberated by it
rather than determined by it? Or to put the question another
way: . For while it may sound reasonable to suppose there
was something to learn in a liberal education, For if there
were something to learn in such an education, then in what
sense are we liberated by it, rather than determined by it?
how there is indeed something to learn in such an education,
then how are we truly liberated by it, rather than merely
determined by it? why  (A finishing school?) (Perhaps go on
to say this might well be the result of any content.) But
then what of education: not to produce a gentleman.) And the
content of a more truly liberal education, then, has to be
identified with different curriculum *other* than in any
truer sense, if this education is to deserve the name
'liberal' by being made inclusive and transforming, its
content will have to be conceived in terms in its liberating
the many rather than perpetuating the few, to liberate all
rather than perpetuate the few, (Mention that St. John's
college 1915 current curriculum bears less resemblance to
this now than did the college 1815.)

"liberal" in liberal education is to mean freedom for all,
rather than initiation, , rather than you were not liberated
by what you thereby learned, but indoctrinated, in athat the
something studied and learned the result of studying and
learning such arts if you encountered this curriculum at
a college today, it would hard not to take it as outlandish,
easy to suspect tempting to suspect it of hard not to think
of it as a mode of indoctrination rather than education.
many of you, I think, would suspect it of being a form of
indoctrination, with a history of oppression. To graduate as
a product of one's education rather than a possesor of it.
Risk of content more generally compromising freedom. Be open
rather than closed. Questions rather than answers. The  word
"liberal" in liberal education. Perhaps this particular list
is outdated. Something else must take its place that still
makes sense, even if different sense, of a liberal
education's content. (Present problem in this paragraph,
then go on to use traditional liberal arts as example of
problem, but this clarifies the sense in which I want to
speak of an idea of liberal art, as opposed to the matter of
liberal art.)This is also why I think one can still say
something on behalf of , I think, that there is something in
the *idea* of a liberal art that cannot be lost if we are to
make any sense of liberal education's content, And if
nothing takes its place, then I think it fair to say we will
have lost the idea of a liberal art, and everything that
goes with it. Which means that no sense is made of liberal
education's content; no sense is made of liberal education
more generally as an answer to the question what it means to
be educated; and no sense is made made in turn of any loss
or mistake in a choice against liberal education. But to
have lost the idea of a liberal art, then, is to have lost
any defense of liberal education that might help secure its
future, and indeed any reason to suppose that liberal
education has a future.

Point to questions as sense of liberal education not having
content. But then challenge is to resolve this: the sort of
content that delivers us to freedom, rather simply involving
the exercise of freedom. Not to give up on content. A risk,
then, that we will lose the idea of a liberal art in an act
of forgetting. Especially if it is a choice between freedom
and servitude. Have paragraph here that describes challenge
to this, in relation to freedom. How one reason old list of
liberal arts outdated is because it made students the
product rather than possessor of education. Also appeal to
question. Stamped as gentleman. Link this to Meno: question
about inquiry: desire to satisfy your wants, have power to
satisfy them, a certain kind of impotence described.
Socrates encounter with slave boy doesn't counter this,
since, after all, boy is still a slave. Perhaps also link to
Santayana, and the singing of a note freely vs singing it in
a song. Also speak of how this produces a kind of internal
external threat, where idea is lost because of a certain
understanding of freedom. 

Which brings me to the worry expressed in my
lecture's title. For while I have been speaking of liberal
education's defense in the abstract, there is no shortage of
defenses in the concrete. Type the words "defense of liberal
education" into Google, and you will find one, it seems, for
every headline proclaiming the death of liberal education.
And not just articles. There have been books to defend
liberal education, most recently [a
bestseller](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-04-19/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html)
by Fareed Zakaria bearing the title [*In Defense of
a Liberal
Education*](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/In-Defense-of-a-Liberal-Education/).[^books]
There have been blogs to defend liberal education, including
[one at St.
John's](http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/) featuring
regular posts by Chris Nelson, the Annapolis
president.[^blogs] There have been campaigns to defend
liberal education, with slogans like *Securing America's
Future: The Power of Liberal Arts Education,* to mention
just one initiative, launched in 2012 by the Council of
Independent Colleges. There have even been think-pieces pondering why, given
all these defenses, liberal education remains in peril, as if
the message hasn't gotten through. 


A Defense of Liberal Education." The Council
of Independent Colleges back in 2012 started a campaign for
the purpose. The president of St. John's in Annapolis has
started his own blog for the purpose, along with a projected
book. And there are already books, including a most recent
run currently sitting at number 1 on NYTimes bestseller
list. The ubiquity of defenses have even produced some
articles about how many defenses there are, and why the
message isn't getting through. 

Article about message not getting through and needing to appeal
to emotion, Delbanco article about ineffability of experience.
Nothing definite to say about the content of a liberal education, and
Delbanco doesn't even try. 

But indeed the message isn't getting through. For I worry
that the idea of a liberal art has indeed been lost. What is
more, I worry that it has been lost in what might be called
an act of forgetting. By this, II will turn to examples of
this in a moment, by way of clarification; but one way to
put what I mean by an act of forgetting, more generally, is
to say that no sense is being made of liberal education's
content, insofar as it is being denied. By this, I mean that
no sense is being made of liberal education's content, out
of a denialI will turn to my evidence for this in a moment,
but   

Reference to "Case to be made" article, then DelBanco article,
especially how to think and how to choose.

There are, of course, many defenses of liberal education,
including a recent book, by Fareed Zakaria, bearing the
title "A Defense of Liberal Education." (Also mention
article that suggests the defenses of liberal arts aren't
working. And the quote (Delbanco?) that it's hard to say
what one gets from liberal education without having 
experienced it for oneself) Also, you don't know what it is until you have
experienced it yourself. Now move on to claim that we have
indeed lost this idea. And lost, in a denial of content, and a kind
of denial of idea.

Perhaps use three examples: Zakaria (no liberal arts), Power of
Liberal Arts (but no idea of one), and finally something from
St. John's College. This should also clarify not just how but why
idea of liberal art is lost, and paper should end with challenge:
how to regain it, by explaining why having content is consistent
with freedom. This would presumably in identifying content with
its production through skill. Or another way to put it: we need
to understand the world as being a place of freedom where
liberal arts are visibly, manifestly, at work. (Not everyone
is to write a great book.)

critical thinking doesn't have a subject, the way logic has a 
subject. 

Second part of paper: why denial of content: because of a tension
between content and freedom. Mention De Anima, nothing before becoming
form of something else, no place for freedom. 

. (Talk of what goes missing in the defense,
starting with liberal arts, moving to content,
subject-matter, and finally an answer.)And insofar (from
here, go on to identify this content with liberal arts, so
defense will have to make a case for them. Then talk about
defenses nowadays, and how they fail by these measures.). 

Or to put this minimal condition another way: it will be
a defense that convinces us liberal education has a content.
Yet this answer, I worry, is one that defenders of liberal
education refuse to give; and what they offer in its place
in essence risks putting the answer they ought to give out
of reach. ses of liberal education is what causes my worry
about the future of liberal education, and prompts the title
of my lecture. The answer, essentially, is this. is this
question that causes my worry, and prompts the title of my
lecture.  

. challenge, it seems to me, is
then to do it  o defend liberal education from the theraAnd
how could a defense of liberal education even address this
threat without facing it, and thus opposing it, but then
treating it, an internal threat, as if it were external?
Even my questions treat the threat this way, as something to
survive or overcome or maintain oneself against, as I try to
conceive of a future in which liberal education still
exists. And this suggests a paradox at the heart of any
defense: for if the threat in this case is to be real, but
not fatal, perhaps it has to be taken as internal and
external at once. But how? How, that is, not just
paradoxically, but intelligibly, even resolutely?  

I hope you can see
the paradox. Even raising this question makes the threat
seem once again external, (speak intelligibly rather than
paradoxically) by opposing it to liberal education, a sign
of the challenge of defense. cast this internal threat in
external terms, My way of putting this question shows how
easy it is to cast even internal threats in external terms.
conceive hard it is  suggests opposition...  By which I
mean, of course, a defense f each of us asked the question
"what does it mean to be educated?" and none of us answered
it by pursuing a liberal education, no one pursued a liberal
education when answerng the question "what does it mean to
be educated?" then  There is a challenge here, and I think

Question defines internality. Answer defines externality,
and indeed a certain way of envisioning the world (where
freedom has a place.) Problem: we don't go external, but
stay internal. What resolves the paradox is to say: an
internal threat makes for an external solution. (Hmm, this
isn't quite right.)  

thenits defense, it would seem,  what can be said in its defense? on its behalf, in its
defense? ow to defend it? For it seems the
treat cannot be conceived  is its best defense for survival
rather than demise?  Perhaps mention paradox here.   

Distinction between question and answer allows defense to
be made.
(Answer should be: an education consistent with freedom.
That's how answer can be wrong. World of servitude. Point
out how technological change being engaged, rather than put
off. Flexible thinking, keeping apace. Also talk about
content.)
(Two alternatives in defense: this is the wrong answer; or,
it answers the question without having asked the question.
We've chosen the latter, but granted then the answer given
against liberal education. Letting other forms of education
be answers, granting their world.) The threat to liberal education is in this sense internal
then. But in the form of a question. This argument might
suggest STEM pursuit the pursuit of a liberal education.
Does liberal education have an answer to the question in its
defense? 
(And this
is my worry.) But liberal education still in
need of defense from a choice to pursue a STEM field, lest
we take this to be liberal education. WE have done this by
identifying freedom, and in question.) (Ask this question to
pursue a liberal education, but does this mean liberal
education is committed to questions or answers in being
defended.)  Squeamish about saying STEM fields aren't
education. Reasonable to say: answer is wrong.


From here I should try to describe how this leads to an
internal threat
(And this can lead to a kind of paradox:
maybe put this later? Or rewrite?) To see what I mean,
consider [the
announcement](<http://www.sjc.edu/programs-and-events/santa-fe/50th-anniversary-conference/>)
St. John's College made for a conference it hosted in Santa
Fe last October. The stated question of the conference was
"What is Liberal Education For?"  Here is how the
announcement begins:

> We raise this question, recognizing that liberal education
> and the great tradition of the American liberal arts
> college have been put on the defensive of late. Small
> colleges across the nation have to make their case to
> students, to their parents, and to the public more
> urgently than ever. The causes of this crisis have been
> analyzed extensively: there is an emerging consensus that
> the rapid growth of consumerism amidst new economic
> challenges, and the fragmentation of general studies
> driven by professional training and specialization in the
> universities, have led us to undervalue drastically the
> humane goals of liberal studies. These causes are
> themselves symptomatic of a deeper crisis in our time, a
> crisis of uncertainty and disorientation affecting every
> field of human endeavor—scientific, social, intellectual,
> artistic, and spiritual. Precisely in response to this
> crisis, liberal education can reaffirm its relevance and
> purposes.

To my mind, this is better than a headline, and even
compelling, so far as it goes. Not because it is longer than
a headline, or more detailed; but because it describes
a threat to liberal education that cannot be simply escaped
or opposed. Which is to say: it describes a threat that is
finally internal. It is *we* who have been led to undervalue
the goals of liberal studies, and *we* who suffer from
a still deeper uncertainty and disorientation, since this
affects every field of human endeavor. But what makes the
paragraph compelling also makes it paradoxical, once we
reach the final sentence. For if every field of human
endeavor suffers from disorientation, then liberal education
suffers from it. But how, in that case, can it respond at
all to the crisis, much less precisely? Any response would
seem to require orientation, even in the throes of
a disorientation having reached the point of crisis. Here,
then, we see how speaking on behalf of liberal education
means distinguishing it from what threatens it, even
when the threat is internal. But we are thus forced to talk
in a kind of paradox: as if liberal education were at once
included in yet excluded from the threat. 

How to resolve this paradox? That is, how do we talk not
just paradoxically, but intelligibly, about liberal
education's powers of guidance in a time of confusion? Or
more generally, how do we defend liberal education against
threats that (put sentence above capturing internality of
issue.) a matter not of what
*others* think or do, but what *we* think or do. These are the questions
that cause my worry, and prompt the title of my lecture.
(Mention looking up other search terms to save liberal
education.) My worry is that we have found a way of talking
that we take to be intelligible, but which in truth is
unintelligible, and a sign of disorientation in the mistake.
And what makes it unintelligible, finally, is its having
lost the idea of a liberal art. Or to put this less
elliptically: we have found a way of talking on behalf of
liberal education, of defending it, that effectively
divorces it from any conception of the liberal arts. And
this divorce has made our defense *seem* sensical, yet *be*
nonsensical. 

To accuse us of nonsense is no small charge, of course. And
there is no case to make for it, I think, that can put it
beyond doubt. In any case, my hope in what follows is not to
make the charge hard to doubt; but merely hard to dismiss,
and in a spirit more probing than polemical.

To get a better sense of what I mean by all
this, we can first turn back to the announcement I just
quoted from. Recall that its first paragraph concluded by
asserting that liberal education can reaffirm its relevance
and purposes, even in the midst of uncertainty and
disorientation. But how? The rest of the announcement offers
an answer to this question: 

>We believe that the unprecedented opportunities for freedom
>in the modern world only heighten the need for life-long
>engagement with the essential questions. Individualism, the
>accelerating progress of science and technology, the
>liberation engendered by complex economies---the very
>achievements of the modern age---present philosophical and
>ethical difficulties, both novel and perennial. No one can
>address these effectively, in their own lives or as future
>leaders, unless they come to understand them in a more than
>superficial way.

> At St. John’s College, it has continued to be our
> conviction that the root questions of life can be taken up
> by any serious person. We have made the Socratic
> approach---of open, courageous, and philosophically minded
> inquiry---central to the work of every class. We welcome
> friends (and critics) and educators from near and far to
> join us for this conference, which we envision as a broad
> platform to speak about the challenges and opportunities
> for liberal education today, and to engage in exemplary
> studies in the liberal arts (interpretive and substantive
> work on texts and within disciplines).  

(Point out that this is just an advertisement, but other things just like it.)
Maybe point out that casting the terms as external means make some kind of sense
of the internal. content given to internal, but I think this
is perhaps wrong. Real threat is internal, only way out is external.
(The real crisis from within: appeal to archimedean point, because there
is no content.) if liberal education can indeed reaffirm its relevance
and purposes precisely in response to this crisis, then it must have resources
to protect it from total disorientation. . (Link internal to universal, no opposition
from it. No esc) And there is no escape from it, if this is
indeed a crisis affecting every field of human endeavor. this reflects a deeper uncertainty
and disorientation in every thing we do. . . is a good example, I think, of what it means
to take a threat to liberal education seriously. , for
a more serious threat to liberal education thanWhat makes
the account of crisis in this paragraph at all compelling,
it seems to me, is that it identifies the crisis with
a concrete "us" rather than some abstract "they." withI
should first focus on how it takes it makes for a more
serious threat than found in a headline by making it
universal and internal, affecting every field of human
endeavor. Yet note how the defense of liberal education
still depends on distinguish it, presumably as a human
endeavor, from the threat. Yet if one takes the threat
seriously, why should liberal education be immune? (Perhaps
don't raise this yet, stick to level of description.) This
paragraph, it seems to me, distinguishes liberal education
from what threatens it to the point of paradox. We are first
asked to believe in a crisis so wide and deep that it
infects every field of human endeavor with disorientation.
Yet we are then asked to believe in the resources of liberal
education to respond to this crisis, as if it were the one
field of human endeavor immune from disorientation.

(Perhaps use term "Archimedean point" for what has to be saved. Another
idea: at this point, we seem to have to be already free.)

headlines, in effect, . as a suggestion, or hypothesis.  To
explain what I mean by it, consider a [recent
attempt](http://www.liberalartspower.org/lowdown/what/Pages/default.aspx)
to answer the question: "What Are The Liberal Arts?"  Here
is how the answer starts:

> A liberal arts education means studying broadly---taking classes in
> many different subjects---and building skills that are geared toward
> more than just one profession.  By studying the liberal arts, students
> develop strong critical thinking, problem solving, and communication
> skills.  Liberal arts students learn to approach questions flexibly

> say they value most, even more than a specific major.  **In today’s
> labor market, career paths are changing rapidly, and graduates must
> draw from a variety of skillsets to adapt to challenges and capitalize
> on opportunities.**

Already we might notice something getting lost in this answer.  True,
it speaks at comparative length of what can be gained by a study of
liberal arts.  But it says almost nothing about what they are.  The
answer so far, it seems, is simply "many different subjects."

But as I said, this is only the start of the answer.  The answer
continues like this:

>You might be surprised by the kinds of subjects and majors that are
>included in the liberal arts.  They include much more than studio art
>and English classes (though those are great!)---they range from
>mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology.  At liberal arts
>colleges and universities students can study the sciences---such as
>biology, chemistry, and physics---and social sciences---including
>economics, political science, and psychology.  Students can study newer
>subjects, such as environmental science and neuroscience, and
>traditional ones, too.

The answer "many different subjects" is elaborated here.  ---But only,
it seems, by way of expansion, to encompass almost any subject you
could think of, or want to study.  We might wonder what *isn't* a
liberal art on this account.  For we have gotten no answer to the
question of what *is* one, which tells us what a liberal art finally
is, no matter how many there might be.  Or, to borrow a figure from
Plato's *Meno*, we could say we've been given a *swarm* of liberal
arts, when we might have wanted just one.  This would be the one that
makes any member of the swarm, indeed, a member.  What we would want,
in that case, might be called the *idea* of a liberal art.  And it
would be this idea, then, that has gotten lost in the answer above.  We
ask what the liberal arts are, and are given too many in reply to
know.

But how many are too many?  The list just given might seem too long, or
at least too indefinite.  Yet consider the most definitive list I can
think of, and the most likely one you already know of.  This is the list
we've inherited from medieval times, composed of seven liberal arts:
grammar, logic, and rhetoric; arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy.
No more, no fewer.  Yet what makes *these* the liberal arts?  It would
seem impossible to know, unless we have some notion, or again *idea*, of
what a liberal art is, to tell us. And if this idea is distinct from any
example, it will not be found on any list of examples, even if the seven
on this particular list---definitive as it is---exhaust the examples.
And not to be found is one way of being lost.  So on this argument, the
idea of a liberal art will be lost on *any* list of them, no matter how
short, or definite.

Being forgotten; another way to be lost; formulation of hypothesis

Still, if we were persuaded by this argument, it seems we would shy away
from lists when trying to say what a liberal art is.  But it is typical
instead to embrace them, as if a liberal art were nothing more than
a one among many. The list I started with, for example, is part of an
ongoing campaign, begun in 2012, to promote the liberal arts by The
Council of Independent Colleges.[^1] And you only find more such
lists---sometimes completed, as it were, with the words "*et cetera*"---
if you ask Google the question "What is a liberal art?".[^2] (Only thing added
to list is use of "et cetera" to complete it, as it were.)

[^1]:The campaign-launch announcement can be found
[here](http://www.cic.org/News-and-Publications/Press-Center/Press-Releases/Pages/campaign-for-liberal-arts.aspx).
[^2]: For one such example, see the list under the heading "What is
liberal arts today?" at [this
website](http://www.topuniversities.com/blog/what-liberal-arts-education).

To base If
there is and where the most commonly listed item is the term "*et
cetera*". equally indefinite breadth, if you do a simple Google search
for the phrase "liberal artsAnd two more lists can be found on [the same
page](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/)
of the current St. John's website.  The first list has twelve items on
it: philosophy, literature, history, mathematics, economics, political
theory, theology, biology, physics, music, chemistry, and languages. And
the second list reduces this twelve to eight: music and literature,
philosophy and theology, history and social science, mathematics and
natural science.  There is nothing that accompanies either list to
explain why *these* are the liberal arts, or to explain why one list
differs from the other, or even to explain why both differ from the
medieval list you may recall.  And if you do recall the medieval list,
you likely recall little else.  Perhaps you remember that grammar,
logic, and rhetoric were grouped together in what was called
a *trivium*, and the rest in a *quadrivium*, but without any comparable
memory of why.  Or perhaps you remember that the word "art" in "liberal
art" means something like "skill," and "liberal" something like
"liberating," but without any comparable sense of what "a liberating
skill" means, or why it should be found in the study of arithmetic or
astronomy.  <!--Maybe mention definition in power of liberal arts page
only going this far.-->

So even if no list of liberal arts contains the idea of one among its
examples, such lists prevail, even in memory. And this suggests a deeper
way of being lost, where not being found means being forgotten. Hence my
lecture's title. In the lost idea of a liberal art, my hypothesis is
that we have indeed forgotten what a liberal art is. And by "we," I mean
those of us on the side of the liberal arts, so to speak. ---Those of us
who would defend them, rather than dismiss them, when talking about the
aims of education. And in this case those of us who would defend them by
drawing up lists of them. But we draw up our lists, on this hypothesis,
in having no idea of a liberal art to offer in their place. We therefore
lack the very thing that makes the examples on our lists examples. And
this, then, is what I mean by "forgotten." For we lack the very thing
that our lists would suggest we possess, as if what we lacked were lost.

Mention Van Doren passage.



But is it lost? Have we indeed forgotten what a liberal art is? It is hard to
know what might *prove* as much. This is why, for better or worse, I call my
lecture's title a hypothesis. (Briefly include here a first reason already given
in the existence of lists at all. Then spell out two more reasons that are
independent of lists per se.) Still, I can think of three reasons for adopting
it; three reasons, that is, for supposing that the idea of a liberal art has
been lost rather than kept. To see what they are, I now want to give a closer look
to the lists of liberal arts already mentioned. The first of these, recall, was the
seemingly indefinite list produced by the Council of Independent Colleges, ranging
from mathematics to Mandarin, from statistics to sociology. 
One reason, it likelier that we have forgotten what a liberal
art is than that we have remembered it. adopting this hypothesis when we read
present-day defenses of liberal education. 

and have no ambitions that my lecture
might persuade you of it as fact. Still, I do hope to persuade you of it as Still, I think this hypothesis better
explains Perhaps you need more evidence to accept such a claim, even in the
form of a hypothesis. To begin this section, speak in terms of accepting the hypothesis, on the
evidence of the list-making; then turn to other things that are clarified
by its adoption. 

But now that I have explained my title and formulated my hypothesis, I want
to offer evidence for it. I wantaccepting this hypothesis? (Revise from here.) (Perhaps put act of forgetfulness here?) So if our
every list is made instead without this knowledge, then what might have
been an act of recollection is rather a state of forgetfurecall it to
mind. making oints backwards, as it were, to an idea that defines them
even if it cannot be found on them, or in us---on this hypothesis. ur
every list of liberal arts invites us, perhaps even obliges us, to
recall what defines it  in this sense, is inviting us to recall
something And this, then, is what I mean by "forgotten." 

we hat we is in the first place would produce no
list of them; 

makes the examples on our every list of liberal arts the examples
they are. 

our every list of examples would suggest something
that made them examples. we give example after example of a
liberal art as if there were something that made them examples but heedless, it seems, of what the examples indeed exemplify. with no heed of recognition of just what the examples exemplify.  we can give example upon example of a liberal art,


(In this paragraph, give more evidence for hypothesis. There are several
threads to sort out here. One, the fact that items on the later lists
are not defined, as they might be on the medieval list. (Perhaps contrast Teach
Yourself Algebra with Elements of Algebra on this; in the one case the elements
are given, and in the other case defined. Also use Liberal Arts book by Joseph,
along with strange website of education defining the terms of the quadrivium.)
In St. John's
case this is highlighted by the fact that we more or less forcibly apply
the list to our readings, and have done so since the time of Buchanan.
Then lead to a clarification of the word "forgetting" as an act rather
than a condition. How St. John's wanted to dispense with "liberal arts"
reference; how "liberal education" can be talked about without any
reference to "liberal arts" in general; how it serves as merely lip
service. But this act of forgetting raises a question: why would the hypothesis
matter? Then move to deeper issue of importance by talking about power.
Also relate this to lack of content.)


the lists, on this hypothesis, are a
symptom of forgetfulness. we draw up our lists, on this hypothesis,
But again there is no idea of a liberal art to
be found on such lists; and on this hypothesis, this is *why* we resort
to lists. we draw up lists of them, on this hypothesis,draw up lists of them, whether to
promote the liberal arts generally, would draw up lists of them in the
attempt to and are wont to defend them, as in the cases just mentioned,
by drawing up lists of them. <(Perhaps put "by 'we" sentence up here.)
(Change this next sentence to: one sign of this is our resorting to
lists; but there are other signs. Then move on to other signs.) And this
is why we resort to lists of them, where no idea of one can be found.
(Need another sentence here.)

as you please, because we lack any notion of a liberal art that might
reduce this many to one.

!--Previous sentence should be revised. Perhaps separate idea of
defense from merely drawing up lists.-->

<!--Another possible way to organize this: don't mention "we" until after
sentence about forgetting leading to resorting to lists. Explain "we" later,
as a challenge to hypothesis. How could "we" on the side of liberal arts
have forgotten what they are?-->

<!--Revise from here: put some sort of "by we, I mean" sentence first.
Then say this is why we resort to lists, etc. Then speak of purpose of
lecture as threefold: (1) To defend the hypothesis (2) Show why it matters
(3) What does recollection look like.-->
<!--Later speak of forgetting as an act rather than a state, or
condition.-->

To think of seven liberal arts on this
hypothesis, or eight, or twelve, or as many as you please, is not a
sign of comprehension but rather a surrogate for it. to recall any
number of liberal arts, whether this be seven, or eight, or twelve, or
indefinitely many, is not a sign of what we comprehend but rather a
surrogate for it. This hypothesis invites us to consider any such list
of liberal arts, whether it numbers seven, or eight, or twelve, or
indefinitely man a list of liberal arts, whether it numbers seven,
comprehension but rather a surrogate for it. We have no idea, on this
hypothesis, what a liberal art is; thus we resort to lists, where no
such idea can be found. of what a liberal art is, just as such; so we
resort to lists, where no such notion can be found.  or the sceond l.
who would defend rather than dismiss the liberal artswho might be
thought most devoted to the liberal arts: we students, and stewards,
of a liberal education. (A sentence here linking the "we" to the
purveyors of the lists above.) On this hypothesis, we have lost any
notion of what a liberal art is, just as such; and this is why we
resort to lists, where no such notion can be found. (Later speak of
how there are borrowings in current lists from current fields of
study.)

we mean by a liberal art,which is why we resort to
lists.  with the problem with our various lists of liberal arts is not
simply that there is no idea of one to be found, buseem comprehensive
but really aren't. give a false sense of their comprehension; we
answer the question of what the liberal arts are with a list of them,
because we have offer lists of liberal arts in answer to the question
of what they are, answer the question "What are the liberal arts?"
with Have the sentence here referring back to lists. On this
hypothesis, there is a false sense of comprehension in the lists of
liberal arts just mentioned, and a lack of insight , will see liberal
arts proliferate on lists, in ostensible defense Perhaps include a
sentence or two here about how this forgetfulness is manifest in the
seeming comprehension of lists. And by "forgotten," I not only mean in
the sense that the idea of a liberal art has vanished from our
thoughts about liberal education, as if by accident; I also mean in
the sense that this idea may have vanished in being banished, as if by
choice. The idea of a liberal art has become something to forget, on
this hypothesis, when we are called upon to explain, or defend, or
even pursue, a liberal education.

But then move to a still deeper sense
of loss, where the forgetting comes first. As a straightforward first
example, give the original version of new website. Then move on to subtler
examples in list, linked to power. But this, to my mind, is not yet the
deepest way of being lost, where being forgotten at once means not
being found. ---Which is to say, where being forgotten is not the
result of being lost, but rather the cause of it. This last sense of
"lost" may seem irrelevant to to the idea of liberal education, And
"forgotten" is what I mean by "lost" in my lecture's title. In the
lost idea of a liberal art, my hypothesis is that we have indeed
forgotten what a liberal art is. But it doesn't explain the
persistence. Which suggests a still deeper way of being lost. not the
result but rather of not being found. here we might say being
forgotten means not being found. (Need to expand this next section.)

It seems as if we can draw up our lists of liberal arts, and
recall them, without feeling the lack of definitions first.  suggests that the idea
of a liberal art is lost on any list not simply by not being found on
it, as if there is something memorable enough about a list of liberal
arts to obscure any like interest in a definition.  Obscures any
content.  For this paragraph: Thus we draw up our lists, and recall
them, without a thought for definitions first.  As if a list at once
obscures the idea while inducing forgetfulness.  (Perhaps mention
St.  John's original idea of getting rid of mentioning liberal arts
altogether.)  This suggests that the idea of a liberal art is lost on
any list not simply by not being found on it, but also by being
forgotten.  And this makes the task of this lecture one of
recollection, like the Meno.  But that had the advantage of discussing
virtue, inherently important.  How to make this topic also important?
By linking it to the Meno.)

both number and kind from the medieval one.  from the medieval one But
which list is the right list? Or at least, the more definitive list?
And does either list, since it differs from the medieval one, mean
that the liberal arts have changed since medieval times? Again, it
would seem that we cannot answer such questions unless we recover, or
we might even say *recollect*, the idea of a liberal art that goes
missing, or gets lost, so soon as we draw up our lists.

Or am I missing the point?  For perhaps there is no *one* list of the
liberal arts, or even competing lists, but rather many lists, even
indefinitely many.  Perhaps nearly any field of study, that is, can be
studied as a liberal art, if only it is studied in a certain way.  But
if so, then what is that way? In this case, too, it would seem that we
need the *idea* of a liberal art to know, making any mere list of them
beside the point.  Indeed, if we press the sense in which a liberal
art is, somehow, an *art*, which is to say, a certain way of doing
something, then we might think that both lists of liberal arts on the
St.  John's website miss the point.  For there we are, treating the
liberal arts as if they were subjects rather than activities.  S o we
draw up a list of such things as philosophy, or physics, or
mathematics, or languages; when we should really be speaking of such
things as conversation, demonstration, translation, experimentation.
But again, to decide whether we have thusly missed the point, it would
seem that we need some sense of what a liberal art is, which no such
list, right or wrong, can provide.

Similarly, if you have any memory of the medieval notion of a
liberal art, mention what we
remember from the medieval conception, which, if it goes beyond the
list, only extends perhaps to the trivium and quadrivium categories,
along with perhaps the sense that liberal arts are those arts, or ways
of doing something, that liberate us.  But none of this with any deeply
felt connection to what we do; then bring up the fact the website had
no reference to liberal arts.  Then move on to this as a different way
of being lost, forgotten, and two reasons for its importance: (1) that
the forgetfulness comes with a shift in the purpose of a liberal
education; and (2) that there is an issue of content.  (spell this
out.))

to promote the liberal arts, that began
in 2012.  : Why? This suggests another way, a deeper way, of being
lost.  But again, this is just one way of being lost.  It is also an
obvious way of being lost.  So why do lists of liberal arts persist.
Introduce another way of being lost.  If we at St.  John's were
convinced, we might feel obliged to define what we mean by a liberal
art.  (Perhaps we could say they are arts that "free" us; but we can
hear Socrates counter: what does "free" mean?)  If we---and by "we" I
mean we at St.  John's College---were convinced of such an argument,
And what to make of more recent lists of liberal arts, which are
equally definite, yet differ from the medieval one, both in kind and
in number?  There are two such lists, for example, on of the
St.  John's College website.  

Or again, as I have putting it, we need the very thing that is more likely lost than found on any such list, in being a list: namely, the *idea* of a liberal art.  

that only *lost* on such lists rather than found there.  Stick with the motif of "being lost" and talk of next issue as a deeper sense of being lost.  Mention how St.  John's website at first had nothing about the liberal arts.

[Move on to explain the deeper importance of this question: the ubiquitousness of lists indicates a certain, and potentially false, understanding of our freedom, and the relation of a liberal art to our freedom.] 

Later, use distinction between servile and liberal to indicate
importance of question, then introduce Meno as a deeper exploration of it.

> Areas of study include philosophy, literature, history, mathematics,
economics, political theory, theology, biology, physics, music,
chemistry, and languages, offering a truly comprehensive liberal arts
education as illustrated in the chart below.  Start with St.  John's
List, pointing out distinction between books and divisions,
comprehensive vs book's beginning, middle, and end.]
[Move on to examples of trivium and quadrivium, then to St.  John's current list]
Final sentenc should be the one below] This, then, is one way to
understand my lecture's title.  For it seems to be the very idea of a
liberal art that is lost [or one might say forgotton] when we identify
the liberal arts by name.

Mention how very act of specification of liberal arts runs this risk,
because of a interest in power.

[Perhaps introduce third paragraph and power here.  Start with Meno and move back to example.]
Explaining why it's easy to forget.  Mention recommendation from
Siegelvision] How we struck liberal arts from website.

"Lost" meaning forgotten, later meaning abandoned.

I'll come to the idea later, but I want to start by asking, why the
forgetfulness?
